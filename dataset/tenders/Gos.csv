"The  Future Fellowships  scheme supports research in areas of critical national importance by giving outstanding researchers incentives to conduct their research in Australia. The aim of the  Future Fellowships  scheme is to attract and retain the best and brightest mid-career researchers. 
 At present many highly qualified mid-career researchers choose to work overseas to further their careers due to lack of opportunities in Australia. The  Future Fellowships  scheme addresses this problem and will significantly boost Australia's research and innovation capacity in areas of national importance. 
 Future Fellowships provide four-year fellowships to outstanding Australian mid-career researchers. In addition, the ARC may award the Administering Organisation up to $50 000 of non-salary funding per annum which may be used for personnel, equipment, travel and field research costs directly related to the Future Fellow's research. 
 The objectives of the Future Fellowships scheme are to: 
 
 ensure that outstanding mid-career researchers are recruited and retained by Administering Organisations in  continuing academic positions 
 build collaboration across industry and/or research organisations and/or disciplines 
 support research in national priorities that will result in economic, environmental, social and/or cultural benefits for Australia 
 strengthen Australia’s research capacity by supporting innovative, internationally competitive research. 
 
  ","A Proposal may only be submitted through the Research Office of an Eligible Organisation listed in the relevant Funding Rules.

"The Aviation Services Accreditation Support Program (the Program) will run over six months from 29 March 2021 to 30 September 2021.  
 The Program represents part of the Australian Government’s continued economic response to the Coronavirus, providing financial assistance to Australia’s aviation industry to assist with the impact on the aviation sector from COVID?19. 
 Capital constraints, a workforce that has been underutilised for an extended period, and prolonged uncertainty are all likely to constrain Australian ground handling companies’ ability to adequately service the industry as activity ramps up. A key challenge is ensuring that the workforce is appropriately trained and certified in line with regulatory requirements. 
  A significant portion of aviation ground handling staff have not worked since March 2020 and due to this long period of negligible flying activity, the ground handling workforce are likely to require retraining and reaccreditation to ensure safety standards are maintained for all flights. 
 Noting that ground handling organisations service all aspects of aviation, the Program will provide capped grants to eligible businesses to contribute to mandatory training, certification, and accreditation of ground handling workers essential for the operation of aircraft. This contribution will set a floor to ensure that the sector is in a position to respond as domestic flying activity recovers. It is anticipated that the Program will cover approximately 30% of the training requirements of the pre-COVID workforce. 
 Training support would be available for both new and existing employees, as required to support aviation recovery. 
 The capped grants will not cover the complete training requirements of all employees.  
 As such, the grants should be distributed appropriately by eligible businesses across their workforces to ensure the objectives of the Program can be met.","To be eligible you must:

"The Manufacturing Integration Stream will support projects that integrate Australian businesses into domestic and international value chains, propelling their goods and services into new markets and fostering Australia’s reputation as a modern manufacturing leader. It will encourage and facilitate linkages between local businesses and domestic and international firms, increasing scale, supply capacity, and the ability to innovate. 
 Australia’s resource sector is world-class. The sector is a leading exporter of energy and resources commodities, serviced by a highly regarded resources technology sector. In 2019 the Australian METS sector generated $97 billion in revenue, supporting approximately 200,000 jobs. However, resources technology is a manufacturing area with untapped potential that could be leveraged further, based on the capability and innovation of Australian businesses in supporting the competitiveness of our resources sector. There are also opportunities to expand the current market footprint by adapting more of these technologies across other Australian sectors, such as defence and space, and capturing more of global markets. 
 Australia has significant reserves of the critical minerals and metals which drive the modern global economy. These are used to manufacture advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, mobile phones and renewable energy. However, because the majority of primary ores are shipped overseas for processing, Australia derives a small share of the potential overall benefit. Australia can capture greater benefit from these value chains by undertaking further value adding and manufacturing here.

This stage involves Indigenous led discussion and planning processes amongst Indigenous Traditional Owners and others and includes the development of a management plan. The management plan identifies the values of the proposed IPA area and the threats to those values, outlines the management goals, and includes the relevant International Union for Conservation of Nature protected area category or categories for which the area will be managed.  
 The IPA project moves to the Dedication Stage following approval of the management plan by Traditional Owners (and endorsement of the plan by the Australian Government) and an informed decision by Traditional Owners to dedicate their Land, or Land and Sea, as an IPA.
