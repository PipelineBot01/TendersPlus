Over the next ten (10) to fifteen (15) years, the size and skill level of the naval shipbuilding and sustainment workforce will need to increase significantly to meet the demands created by the Government’s planned investments in naval shipbuilding.  The naval shipbuilding enterprise is too important for the market forces of supply and demand to manage growth and skilling requirements. A national approach to rebuilding the naval shipbuilding and sustainment workforce is required. On 24 March 2017, the Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP announced that the Government will establish a Naval Shipbuilding College to identify, train and retain workers for the naval shipbuilding enterprise.  The NSC project is expected to be delivered through three phases, with progress to the next phase dependent on the successful achievement of the previous phase:• the first phase will commence in 2018 and focus on establishing the NSC; is expected to build capacity and annual throughput at existing education and training institutions across Australia, in key entry level trade qualifications. It will commence a nation-wide communication program, including a career awareness program for school level audiences and workers in adjacent industries; and create a workforce register;• the second phase of the Naval Shipbuilding College is expected to commence in 2020/21. The College will continue to increase capacity and student throughput in key entry-level trades, and will build on this to also achieve increased capacity and throughput in key higher education qualifications (such as naval architecture/engineering) from universities; and• the final phase of the NSC Project could commence from around 2022-2023, subject to successful implementation of the first two phases, and is to develop and construct a purpose-built Naval Shipbuilding College training facility located at the Osborne Naval Shipyard that will offer a range of naval shipbuilding and sustainment education and training that cannot be met from existing institutions.  To support the establishment and delivery of the NSC, the Commonwealth, through the Defence of Defence, is seeking to engage with the broader training and education industry and with potential NSC providers to:• provide informed input and innovative ideas that can be considered by the Commonwealth in determining the optimal service development and delivery solution for the NSC; and• enable an industry partner or partners to be selected to deliver the first two phases of NSC outcomes.    ",Naval Shipbuilding College,6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fe7ba,,"Respondents are invited to submit a proposal to support the development and delivery of a Naval Shipbuilding College (NSC) to facilitate the delivery of the workforce outcomes required to build and sustain Australia’s naval shipbuilding endeavour, as outlined in the Naval Shipbuilding Plan, released by the Government on 16 May 2017.

Proc-9175501,Crop production and management and protection,"The Australian canola industry has produced on average 3.5 million tonnes annually over the past 5 years, with exports alone resulting in $1.6 billion annually. In addition to direct profits from canola production, canola is an essential part of the cropping system, providing significant and reliable yield benefits through the control of diseases and weeds for subsequent cereal crops. The projection for the Australian canola industry is to produce 6.1 million tonnes per year by 2025 (Australian Oilseeds Federation). Some of the main limitations to this expansion and threats to the canola industry are from diseases, especially those caused by fungi. Without the continual control of diseases such as blackleg and sclerotinia stem rot, the canola industry cannot be sustainable or profitable. Furthermore, with the continual expansion of the canola industry the impact of these diseases will only increase due to the intensification of rotations and greater amounts of disease inoculum. The total estimated area planted with canola in 2016 was 615,661 hectares (Northern region), 654,023 hectares (Southern region) and 2,541,302 hectares (Western region) with an average of at least 50% of this being impacted by diseases particularly in the medium-high rainfall zones. The price per tonne in 2016/2017 was $520 and the yield was estimated at 1.4 tonnes per hectare averaged across all regions. With 15% diseases impact, the cost to the industry was over $200M. The aim of this research is to further develop the existing national canola pathology program to maintain the profitability of the canola industry.

Production will occur at two reliable sites, producing approximately 28 tonnes of seed for approximately 230 commercial winter crop varieties. This initiative will create considerable savings by co-ordinating the seed bulk-up of GRDC research investments, creating larger economies of scale and reducing duplication of resources.  This procurement will source, through an open market approach, a service provider who has the appropriate technical skills and experience to deliver the project outcomes..Common Seed Bulk Up 2020-2024","[('seed bulk grdc', 0.7226), ('project outcomes common', 0.2535), ('durum oat chickpea', 0.2255), ('service provider appropriate', 0.122), ('create considerable savings', 0.2068)]"

PROC-9176376,Crop production and management and protection,"Grain legumes have been widely grown in Western Australia, with lupins the most dominant species due to their suitability to acidic sandy soils. Although high value pulses may not be suited to all soil types and regions, there are areas of WA (soil type x environment) where they are highly suited. Despite this, the adoption of grain legumes in these areas has been poor and the proportion of pulses in the farming system is suboptimal and in fact declining. There has also been a stagnation of lupin yields (GN members pers.comms).     Since inception of GRDCs Western Region Regional Cropping Solutions networks (now GRDC Grower Networks), growers have continually highlighted that there are no specifically adapted or consistently profitable break crops/legume options for their farming systems.  Research is ongoing to select for acid and chilling tolerant crop species which will expand the areas where grain legumes can reliably be grown in WA. However even with existing species and cultivars, there are rotational and economic advantages from incorporating grain legumes into the farming system that are not being realised.     Of the commercially available grain legume species, faba bean and lentils are generally acknowledged as being most sensitive to soil acidity, however they are successfully grown on slightly acidic soils (pHCa >5.0 - 6.0) in the high and medium rainfall zones of south eastern Australia, albeit with somewhat inconsistent yields. The experiences of growers and advisers indicate that faba bean are the best pulse crop adapted to high rainfall areas or on soils prone to waterlogging. Chickpea can tolerate a wider range of spring temperatures and have a lower water requirement compared to faba beans so are suited to neutral to alkaline soils in a lower rainfall zone. Chickpeas and lentils can be sensitive to low temperatures and frosts.  There is renewed interest from growers and the agricultural community in grain legume break crops to complement canola and cereals in the rotation.
