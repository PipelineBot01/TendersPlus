In addition to direct profits from canola production, canola is an essential part of the cropping system, providing significant and reliable yield benefits through the control of diseases and weeds for subsequent cereal crops. The projection for the Australian canola industry is to produce 6.1 million tonnes per year by 2025 (Australian Oilseeds Federation). Some of the main limitations to this expansion and threats to the canola industry are from diseases, especially those caused by fungi. Without the continual control of diseases such as blackleg and sclerotinia stem rot, the canola industry cannot be sustainable or profitable. Furthermore, with the continual expansion of the canola industry the impact of these diseases will only increase due to the intensification of rotations and greater amounts of disease inoculum. The total estimated area planted with canola in 2016 was 615,661 hectares (Northern region), 654,023 hectares (Southern region) and 2,541,302 hectares (Western region) with an average of at least 50% of this being impacted by diseases particularly in the medium-high rainfall zones. The price per tonne in 2016/2017 was $520 and the yield was estimated at 1.4 tonnes per hectare averaged across all regions. With 15% diseases impact, the cost to the industry was over $200M. The aim of this research is to further develop the existing national canola pathology program to maintain the profitability of the canola industry. The project will monitor all diseases of canola and provide information to farmers regarding management of these diseases and risk of yield loss ensuring enduring profitability to the Australian canola growers.","National Canola Pathology Program – epidemiology, surveillance and management strategies",6159c38f9107b6df81b19121,70140000.0,1.0

This will be achieved by working directly with growers, FERTCARE accredited advisors and industry across the southern region to demonstrate the process and benefits of soil and plant testing, and improved crop nutrition advice across two seasons. An economic framework will be developed to quantify the likely returns from improved nutrient management techniques and the opportunity to boost farm profit, and these findings will be extended to other growers not directly involved in the demonstration program. The large numbers of soil profile analyses collected by the demonstration program (about 7,000 p.a.) will also provide a useful snapshot of nutrient status and soil fertility in these states, and could be used to highlight emerging issues like soil acidity and declining organic matter.  This proposed investment would be undertaken from 30 May 2018 to 30 June 2021 and will be delivered across the GRDC Southern Region.  ",Using soil & plant testing data to better inform nutrient management & optimise fertiliser investments for grain growers,6159c38f9107b6df81b19227,70140000.0,1.0

26763,PROC-9176376,Grains Research and Development Corporation,Crop production and management and protection,13-Aug-21 5:00 pm,"Grain legumes have been widely grown in Western Australia, with lupins the most dominant species due to their suitability to acidic sandy soils. Although high value pulses may not be suited to all soil types and regions, there are areas of WA (soil type x environment) where they are highly suited. Despite this, the adoption of grain legumes in these areas has been poor and the proportion of pulses in the farming system is suboptimal and in fact declining. There has also been a stagnation of lupin yields (GN members pers.comms).     Since inception of GRDCs Western Region Regional Cropping Solutions networks (now GRDC Grower Networks), growers have continually highlighted that there are no specifically adapted or consistently profitable break crops/legume options for their farming systems.  Research is ongoing to select for acid and chilling tolerant crop species which will expand the areas where grain legumes can reliably be grown in WA. However even with existing species and cultivars, there are rotational and economic advantages from incorporating grain legumes into the farming system that are not being realised.     Of the commercially available grain legume species, faba bean and lentils are generally acknowledged as being most sensitive to soil acidity, however they are successfully grown on slightly acidic soils (pHCa >5.0 - 6.0) in the high and medium rainfall zones of south eastern Australia, albeit with somewhat inconsistent yields. The experiences of growers and advisers indicate that faba bean are the best pulse crop adapted to high rainfall areas or on soils prone to waterlogging. Chickpea can tolerate a wider range of spring temperatures and have a lower water requirement compared to faba beans so are suited to neutral to alkaline soils in a lower rainfall zone. Chickpeas and lentils can be sensitive to low temperatures and frosts.  There is renewed interest from growers and the agricultural community in grain legume break crops to complement canola and cereals in the rotation. This has been highlighted in the Esperance port zone where the climate for much of the port zone and attitude of the growers is conducive to the success of these alternative legume crops and pastures. ",Closing the Economic Yield Gap for Grain Legumes in WA,6159c38f9107b6df81b19f2d,70140000.0,1.0

Taller harvested stubble in this investment is referring to taller than current “standard” residue levels for each region within the Western region. Currently most growers within WA, would harvest around 15cm (beer can height) above ground level to maximise HWSC.  This proposed investment is a preliminary step that looks to compare conventional stubble structures and heights, and load (straw & chaff) with taller stubble residue systems, heights and load (mostly only chaff) and in frost risk areas, a no residue system. Treatments will be implemented using grower equipment and will be replicated.   Importantly the investment will include monitoring of soil moisture, plant establishment, presence of disease, weed competitiveness and herbicide efficacy, HWSC options, nutrient budgeting and ultimately grain yield responses.

A focus of the Data Framework is making GRDC’s R,D&E data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The Catalogue will help make data findable. Datasets can be described in the catalogue, which will be searchable online. This helps growers, researchers, and innovators know what data exists and could be re-used, with following benefits:    accelerate R,D&E outcomes  drive innovation through unlocking new opportunities with data and analytics  improve re-use of datasets and avoid duplication  new insights for the grains industry    This platform is not a repository, and will exist to point users to the location of GRDC-owned datasets so that they can apply to the relevant custodian for safe access to the data. GRDC’s approach to sharing or licensing of data are unchanged by the development of this Catalogue. GRDC will still share/license datasets under terms that have been agreed with dataset co-owners and consistent with its Commercialisation Principles. The Data Catalogue platform will integrate with internal and external (e.g. Research Data Australia) systems to maximise utility and visibility.

Mollusc management consists of an integrated, year-round approach comprising cultural, mechanical, and chemical (baiting) methods, including: physical control methods prior to crop sowing (e.g., stubble burning, slashing, rolling, cabling and grazing), chemical control methods prior to crop harvest (e.g., baiting in the field with approved chemicals) and physical control methods at or after harvest (e.g., use of a modified header, grain cleaning).
