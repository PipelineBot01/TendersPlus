of the conversion of radiation into thermal energy
and the interaction of radiation with geometrical
structures. The key application in focus is the
conversion of concentrated solar radiation into useful
energy in Concenterated Solar Power (CSP) systems.
In CSP systems, solar radiation incident on
a concentrating optics system is focalised on a receiver
that converts it into heat at high-temperature.
The resulting heat can be used in a variety
of systems: a thermodynamic engine to produce electricity,
a chemical reactor to run thermo-chemical
processes (eg. solar fuels production), as industrial
process heat (eg. drying and cooking processes)
or stored in a thermal energy storage system for
later use (at night time or peak pricing hours on
the electricity grid for example). My objective
is to improve the economical viability of CSP systems
by improving the performance and lowering the
cost of concentrating optics and receivers. This task
requires the consideration of the whole chain
of heat-transfer processes: the emission of thermal
radiation by the sun towards the earth, the optical
concentration process, the absorption of radiation
on high-temperature absorber surfaces and the
transport of the absorbed thermal energy outside
of the receiver control volume. Concentrating optics
systems generally work within the geometrical limit
of optics and redirect solar radiation, using
reflective or refractive optics, to focal lines or
points and allowing higher temperatures and thermodynamic
efficiencies to be reached. There are fundemental
limits associatied to this process and some
of them relate to the geometrical distribution
of radiation in space. My research in concentrating
optics includes the development of optical modelling
tools and methods for existing and new concentrator
designs using open-source softwares ( ,  ).
This work makes extensive use of Monte-Carlo Ray-Tracing
(MCRT) techiques to simulate radiative fluxes
in non-ideal geometries and provide accurate
results for the design of complex systems. Typical
systems include heliostat fields, parabolic dish
concentrators, solar furnaces and hybrid versions
of these systems. In a more theoretical aspect of
my research, I study the fundemental thermodynamic
limits to the conversion of concentrated radiation
into work, analysing the consequences of the second
law of thermodynamics in concentrating and high-temperature
radiant systems. This fundemental understanding
of the irreversibilities in optical and
radiant systems can highlight their limitations
and potentially help improve their designs and efficiency.
The energy conversion process in receivers
involves coupled radiation/heat-transfer modes that
depend on the geometry of the device, materials
used and surface properties. Many avenues of research
have been suggested to improve the efficiency
of these receivers, my interest is on the geometrical
considerations involved in the design process,
both at the macroscopical and microsopical levels.
The preferred method to study non-trivial radiative
heat- transfer problems in such systems is MCRT.
MCRT can be very flexible and accurate but relatively
slow and computationally intensive. This
limitation hinders the potential for optimisation
which in turns impact the efficiency of the overall
technology. My approach to this problem is to develop
stochastic optimisation methods embedded in
MCRT to optimise receiver geometries with an affordable
computational time. In addition, by introducing
multi-objective optimisation criteria and evolutionary
algorithms, my methods can be used to refine
designs and explore the complex behaviour of high
temperature optical systems. This work borrows
techniques from the optimisation, computer science
and machine learning fields and applies them to
the design of solar energy systems. The methods developped
have been successfully used to design a 
for the Big Dish concentrator at the ANU. At the micro
and nano-scale, I am interested in studying how
high-temperature surface gratings, self-assembled
structures and photonic crystals can potentially
help to improve receiver effciencies by influencing
the spectral and directional selectivity of radiant
surfaces. This work stands at the crossroad
between optical physics, material science and thermodynamics
and explores an alternative option to efficient
high-temperature photo-thermal conversion.

43,"Bio Research I am doing research in the fields of Hierarchical
Task Network (HTN) Planning and Partial
Order Causal Link (POCL) Planning. I'm interested
in theoretical foundations (mostly complexity analyses),
algorithms, and heuristics of/for those fields.
For a more detailed description of my research
interests see the respective tab or check out
some of my papers. News  PhD under my supervision",,"As my doctoral thesis, my research interests span from
theory to practice -- content-wise all is concerned
with either Hierarchical Task Network (HTN)
planning or Partial Order Causal Link (POCL) planning.
Hierarchical Task Network Planning Short explanation
of HTN planning: HTN planning is an approach
to planning that's centered around problem decomposition.
We are given an initial task network --
a partially ordered set of primitive or compound
(or abstract) tasks. Primitive tasks are the actions
known from classical planning, i.e. they specify
preconditions and effects stating in which states
they are applicable and how they chance a state
if applied. Compound tasks are just abstracts of pre-defined
task networks, so they are essentially
just (parametrised) names like go(Canberra,Sydney).
The planning model specifies rules how they can
be achieved. These rules, called decomposition methods,
are simply mappings to pre-defined task networks,
which can in turn contain compound tasks. The
goal is to refine the initial task network into
a primitive one that is executable. HTN planning is
more expressive than classical planning, where this
mechanism of task decomposition does not exist.
In its most general form (as just explained) it's
undecidable. My research interests in HTN planning
are, roughly ordered by my interest: Partial Order
Causal Link (POCL) Planning Short explanation
of POCL planning: POCL planning is a technique for
solving classical panning problems, where we would
like to find a plan in order to achieve some (state-based)
goals. In POCL planning, this is done in
the space of partially ordered (also called non-linear)
plans. Search is done in a regression-like
fashion starting with the goals: select a condition
not yet achieved (called ""open"") and select an
appropriate action (i.e., with matching effect) from
the plan or model and ""document"" that goal achievement
by the insertion of a so-called causal link.
Tis procedure is repeated until a goal plan has
been found. Since search nodes are partially ordered
plans (rather than states as in standard progression
search), heuristic desingn is much more complicated.
Some more background of POCL planning: Since
roughly 15 years this kind of problem solving
is generally regarded outdated (some even say obsolete!)
because state-based progression search is
simply much more efficient nowadays. However, this
argument is a purely empirical one. Moreover, there
is a vast variety of well-informed heuristics in
classical state-based planning, but almost none
exist in POCL planning. Hence, it's interesting to
imagine where POCL could be by now if we had as well-informed
heuristics for that search as well. (Whether
this can even be is another question, as some
of my theoretical results indicate that heuristic
design is computationally harder than in the progression
setting.) Another important note to make
is that POCL techniques are still used in hierarchical
planning, as one of the few standard techniques
for solving HTN problems relies on POCL planning
techniques. My research interests in POCL planning
are, roughly ordered my interest: Practical application
Well, most that I am interested in is already
covered above as part of HTN planning: When
ever one integrates a human into the loop, several
new questions arise that need to be addressed in
a systematic way. For instance, once we have found
a solution to a problem (i.e., a plan) that plan
can be executed successfully as otherwise it wouldn't
be a solution. However, for a human it might
be a big difference in which order its actions are
executed (by him or her) since there might be a switch
of contexts that could be confusing or even
annoying. Finding a reasonable (we called it ""user-friendly"")
reordering is one such task that can be
investigated on both a formal and an empirical level.
Other related questions, as mentioned above,
are the presentation of plans on higher levels of
abstraction and the explanation of plans. Another
important aspect in the practical application of
planning technology is the planning language's level
of expressiveness. In order to solve real-world
problems, we need to be able to express time (at
the least!) or more generally functions. This will
require new formalisms, reductions, and heuristics.",

a novel ultrafast bootstrap approach (UFBoot).
These methods represent three key steps in every phylogenetic
analysis. A significant outcome from this
research theme is the widely used IQ-TREE phylogenetic
software ( ), which I have continuously developed
since 2011. IQ-TREE has received a lot of
user enthusiasms and integrated in many phylogenetic
pipelines. Currently, I am leading an international
team from Austria, Australia and Vietnam to
jointly develop IQ-TREE. Driven by the rapid growth
of large phylogenomic datasets coupled with increasing
impact of model violation, I jointly developed
many new statistical models for phylogenomics
including partition models, polymorphism-aware models,
distribution free models, mixture models and
site-specific models. These advanced models have been
implemented in IQ-TREE, representing the first
time availability in a prominent maximum likelihood
framework. Applications play an important role
in my search, not only to show the usefulness of bioinformatics
methods but also to identify potential
limitations of existing models. Hence, I have collaborated
with many biologists to analyse empirical
datasets ranging from virus to bacteria and eukaryotes.
Such collaborations include: the origin
of photosynthetic enzymes, deep insect phylogeny using
transcriptomic data, origin of helizoan protists,
Algae and Cryptista using phylogenomic data,
HIV full-genome phylogeny. During my PhD study I introduced
efficient algorithms for many biodiversity
conservation questions such as: Which species/areas
should we prioritise for conservation, such that
the phylogenetic diversity conserved is maximised?
How to measure biodiversity when evolution is
not treelike? The algorithms that I developed range
from greedy algorithm to dynamic programming and
integer linear programming. Especially the last
technique generally works for extended conservation
problems under budget constraint or prey-predator
interactions.",

The quest for abundant renewable energy is currently

Solar energy is by far the most abundant
clean energy source available. In order to achieve
the vision of a world powered by renewable resources,
we need cheap and highly efficient ways to
replace fossil fuels in electricity generation and
transport. In our work we are focusing on both these
areas, with the aim of creating high efficiency
solar cells to help bring down the cost of solar
power, and creating low cost solar fuels by using
sunlight to split water. This involves fundamental
conceptual advances in our understanding of the
physics and chemistry of materials and their interactions
with light, in order to design and fabricate
high efficiency devices. We also need to consider
how to integrate these technologies into the broader
energy system, as our current system was designed
around fossil fuels. This requires high level

that, in my position as a Senior Research Associate
on an ARC Large Grant held by Dr Rajeev Gore at
the ANU) has largely been embedding a display calculus

cut-elimination theorem. In the course of
work on a stronger result, the strong normalization
property of the set of proof reductions used in
cut-elimination, we discovered that the published
proof of this omits a case, requiring a largely new
proof, which we have now completed. We have realised
that this proof can be translated into the context
of general term-rewriting theory, and have accordingly
derived theorems on termination of term-rewriting.

devices   The ability to detect bio-molecule
at ultra-low concentrations (e.g. atto-molar)
will enable the possibility of detecting diseases
earlier than ever before. A critical challenge for
any new bio-sensing technology is to optimize two
metrics --- shorter analysis time, and higher concentration
sensitivity in clinically relevant small
volumes. Moreover, practical considerations are
equally important: simplicity of use, mass producible
(low cost), and ease of integration within the
clinical structure. Compared with other methods,
nano-electro-mechanical system (NEMS) based bio-sensors
are promising in clinical diagnostics because
of their extremely high mass sensitivity, fast response
time and the capability of integration on
chip. We have demonstrated a low concentration DNA
(atto-molar sensitivity) optically interrogated ultrasonic
mechanical mass sensor, which has ordered
nanowire (NW) array on top of a bilayer membrane.
This method represents a mass-based platform technology
that can sense molecules at low concentrations,
which could be useful for early-stage disease
detection. We can develop this sensor further to
measure an array of biomarkers (e.g. DNA or proteins),

My research work is focused on algorithms and
computational models related to metagenomics binning.Metagenomics
involves the study of various genetic
material obtained from the genomes found in microbial
communities. A microbial community such as
lake water or forest soil can contain a large number
of organisms. We need to identify the species
present in order to investigate the taxonomic structure
of a given metagenomic sample. Firstly, reads
are assembled into longer contigs which are then
binned into groups of contigs that belong to different
taxonomic groups present in the metagenomic
sample. Various reference-free contig-binning methods
have been proposed previously that make use of
composition and covergae information of the contigs.
However, the majority of these tools fail to
recover short contigs. As metagenomic contigs are
derived from assembling the reads, they are output
from the underlying assembly graph which holds valuable
connectivity information between contigs that
can be used for binning. My research work aims
to develop improved contig-binning tools that can
recover short contigs and bin the contigs accurately

I'm convinced that we can use computing systems

computers, including embedding computers into new
physical settings and to exploit machine learning

interact with our complex creative activities. My

Projects could involve Get in touch if you would
like to work with me in these areas! I'm particularly
interested in supervising projects that involve
creating new computer systems and then testing
them in artistic application. (see below for ideas!)
 Here’s some project ideas that could be extended
or shaped to suit you: Most generative music
systems just create new music, this project would
involve training discriminator neural networks to
tell if music was created by a human, or a cutting
edge ANN such as   or  . This project involves
creating a sequence-to-sequence ANN that can generate
harmony, or counter-melodic parts for a given
melody. The focus here would be to deploy this network
in a music creating app such as  . The idea of
this project is to take an existing melody created
in an interactive music system and change its style,
or improve it in some way. It could involve
modifying the melody to fit a particular harmony,
or create a more appealing melodic shape. Various
sequence-to-sequence ANN techniques could be applied
here, and such a system could have applications
in musical performance and education. The idea of
generating digital audio directly from a neural network
is exciting and there are stunning results
from examples such as  ,  ,  , and  . Projects in
this area will involve finding new application areas
for neural audio generation and developing focussed
and fast algorithms with appropriate training
data for use in these areas. In particular, the use
of these networks for creative arts is still being
actively explored.  has a long history, but is
yet to break into mainstream music technology systems.
In this project, you will develop an interactive
music application (e.g., web or mobile app) for
generating and assessing music created using an
evolutionary algorithm. A novel approach might involve
the human user evaluating some generated sounds,
while others are analysed by an automatic system
using MIR techniques or a discriminator neural
network. The MDRNN is an exciting sequence model
that can generate multiple continuous valued signals
from a Gaussian mixture model at each step in time.
This project will involve applying and extending
my   into new applications in the creative arts
and beyond. We’ve tried using the MDRNN for voice
synthesis, motion capture data synthesis, and musical
control data synthesis, but there are lots of
other potential applications waiting for you to
discover, e.g.: predicting future sensor values, generating
robot movements, generating world models

computer vision: applications including person re-identification
and medical image understanding;
fundamental problems including dataset-level learning,
deep learning and synthetic data analysis. I
am looking for PhD students with excellent English
ability, coding ability, and motivation. A potential
PhD student should have high GPA and rich experience
in research. If you are a master student and
intend to apply for a PhD, it is best you have publications
in top venues like CVPR/ICCV/ECCV.   If
you are interested in a visiting scholar position,
please be kindly reminded that I do not have funding
for it. If you can secure externel funding support
and if you are highly motivated and experienced
in research, please drop me an email.   To ANU
students. If you are an ANU undergraduate or postgraduate
student looking for an individual research
project, please be advised that I usually have
2-3 project students each year and that 24-unit projects
are preferred. Please email me to arrange a
discussion beforehand. My personal homepage is at",,"Computer vision, machine learning, deep learning",

of Computer Science in the Australian National University.
His research addresses the design and evaluation
of natural interaction enhanced user interfaces
for various user applications. Examples of
natural interaction modes include human eye gaze,
head motion, and gestures. Augmenting traditional
control interfaces (which use input devices such as
joysticks, keyboards and mice) with these natural
interaction modes offer the possibility of creating
machine control interfaces that are easier to
learn, and provide more effective control of complex
machinery than traditional systems.",,"Dingyun is a Research Fellow at the Research School

systems like airplanes, or submersibles (and swarms
thereof) for the last 20 years. Combining cutting-edge
research with real-world requirements and
deployed vehicles delivers an rewarding stream of
challenges. Deploying scalable swarms of vehicles
- either in air or underwater - is a central goal

which include energy management and scalable, real-time
communication as two of the hardest ones. ",
