Crop production and management and protection,"National Canola Pathology Program – epidemiology, surveillance and management strategies","The Australian canola industry has produced on average 3.5 million tonnes annually over the past 5 years, with exports alone resulting in $1.6 billion annually. In addition to direct profits from canola production, canola is an essential part of the cropping system, providing significant and reliable yield benefits through the control of diseases and weeds for subsequent cereal crops. The projection for the Australian canola industry is to produce 6.1 million tonnes per year by 2025 (Australian Oilseeds Federation). Some of the main limitations to this expansion and threats to the canola industry are from diseases, especially those caused by fungi. Without the continual control of diseases such as blackleg and sclerotinia stem rot, the canola industry cannot be sustainable or profitable. Furthermore, with the continual expansion of the canola industry the impact of these diseases will only increase due to the intensification of rotations and greater amounts of disease inoculum. The total estimated area planted with canola in 2016 was 615,661 hectares (Northern region), 654,023 hectares (Southern region) and 2,541,302 hectares (Western region) with an average of at least 50% of this being impacted by diseases particularly in the medium-high rainfall zones. The price per tonne in 2016/2017 was $520 and the yield was estimated at 1.4 tonnes per hectare averaged across all regions. With 15% diseases impact, the cost to the industry was over $200M. The aim of this research is to further develop the existing national canola pathology program to maintain the profitability of the canola industry. The project will monitor all diseases of canola and provide information to farmers regarding management of these diseases and risk of yield loss ensuring enduring profitability to the Australian canola growers.",canola,australian,diseas,million,crop,canola,pathology,national,[nonetag],[nonetag],1,
