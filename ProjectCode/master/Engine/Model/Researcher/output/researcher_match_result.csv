Canberra00380,0.010161412995136216,Canberra00008,Centre for Change Governance,"Professor Gerry Stoker is Professor of Politics and Governance at the University of Southampton, UK and has recently joined ANZSIG as a Centenary Professor. He held previous professorial posts at Manchester and Strathclyde. Professor Stoker’s main research interests are in governance, democratic politics, local and regional governance, urban politics, public participation and public service reform. He has authored or edited over 20 books and published over 70 refereed articles or chapters in books. Professor Stoker was the founding Chair of the New Local Government Network which won the UK think tank of the year in 2004 and his most recent book ‘Why Politics Matters’ won the 2006 political book of the year award from the Political Studies Association of the UK. Professor Stoker has provided advice to various parts of the UK government and is also an expert advisor to the Council of Europe on local government and participation issues. In 2004, he won the Political Studies Association Award for ‘making a difference’ in recognition of the impact of his work on governance issues.It was in the area of urban politics and local government studies that Professor Stoker first made his name and continues to be seen as a leading authority. He has been a prolific publisher in this area notably The Politics of Local Government, Local Government in Europe, Theories of Urban Politics and Rethinking Local Democracy. For five years (1992-7) Professor Stoker was Programme Director of a £2m research endeavour run for the UK’s Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC) under the title of the Local Governance Programme. Two edited books captured the main output of the programme The New Management of Local Governance and The New Politics of Local Governance. A single authored book Transforming Local Governance on the reforms undertaken by New Labour was published in early 2004 and later that year an edited book on British Local Government into the 21st Century emerged that analyzed New Labour’s reform in more detail. From April 2002 Professor Stoker has been heading up the major Government funded five-year evaluation of the new constitutional and standard arrangements introduced into local government in the UK by the 2000 Local Government Act (see www.elgnce.org.uk for research reports and publications). In more normative vein he has been a strong advocate of a new localism and a greater devolution in the approach to governance both in the UK and beyond.A further theme of Professor Stoker’s work has been his interest with citizen participation, social capital and civil renewal. This work led to the development of a heuristic to help public authorities investigate their public participation strategies and identify how they might be improved. The Council of Europe has adopted this CLEAR framework and used it in a range of municipal settings throughout Europe. More recently, Gerry’s focus has been on understanding the changing nature of citizen participation in a range of country settings including Australia. Indeed, he will help meet the Institute’s aim of designing and analysing unique data sets on the qualities of Australian democracy and (where appropriate) processes of democratisation internationally.",Canberra00008,Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance,"Dr Selen Ercan is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance, University of Canberra.

He joined the University of Canberra at the beginning of July, 2015.He co-founded, and co-edits, the Berghahn (Oxford/New York) journal Democratic Theory and established, and now co-edits, the Palgrave Macmillan book series The Theories, Concepts and Practices of Democracy (both with Mark Chou from the Australian Catholic University).Gagnon’s research into democracy is driven by three programs. The first is an ongoing empirical effort to catalog democracy’s adjectives – so far 1,217 have been found in the English literature – and to inquire about what knowing these adjectives may come to mean or be used for. The second is to continue contributing to the theory of non-human democracy by trying to draw lessons for human democracies from the practices of non-human others (e.g. how do different non-human species solve collective action problems and what, from this, resonates with the theory or practice of democracy today?). The third is to contribute to globalising the history of democracy from a democratic theory perspective which interacts with what John Keane, Benjamin Isakhan, Yves Schemeil, Steve Muhlberger and Phil Paine, and Martin Bernal, among others, have been doing.His recent publications and interests span democracy's many histories (forgotten democracies, narrative, comparison, discourse analysis, epistemology, is democracy even human?), finding ways forward among a number of problems or puzzles that democracies presently face (democracies across dialogues; democracy education / civics and young people, democracy apps, critical and normative arguments, political reform), and critically theorizing the futures of democracy – those ‘democracies to come’ (Isaiah Berlin, fiction, posthumanism, futurism, normative arguments, Anthropocene / Holocene democracy).Please contact for: - Research collaboration - PhD, Master's, Honour's supervision - AdvocacyTo view Jean-paul's The Conversationprofile, please click here.",Canberra00008,Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance,"Dr Selen Ercan is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance, University of Canberra.

He is known internationally for his work in medicalisation and mental health, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and public policy, and the influence of minority parliaments on governance and policy administration.Brenton’s diverse academic and professional experience equips him to create research with real-world impact, genuinely collaborate in research implementation and translate findings for non-academic audiences. He specialises in co-design and coproduction of bespoke social modelling and evaluation methodologies that incorporate the policy, practice and place-based expertise of professionals working in complex social contexts.His academic work was the first to identify a link between low SES and greater medication use for ADHD in Australia. He also conducted the first study of the experiences of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD looking at the impact on identity and access to supports. Brenton was also one of a team of UK-based academics who ran the first English citizen’s assemblies on the devolution of powers from Westminster.His professional experience includes time as Director (Public Policy) with Nous Group consultants and Director (Research) with Catholic Social Services Australia. In these roles, he built a strong practical knowledge of the health and social service sectors. He also developed high quality research strategy to support national policy, evaluation and advocacy work in these sectors. This includedworking with colleagues at ANU and twenty-one Catholic social service agencies to coproduce the first nationally consistent analysis of disadvantage drivers by suburb across Australia.On behalf of Commonwealth Departments, Brenton has led national reviews and evaluations in aged care, community health, home care and mental health. He has also worked in the Australian Public Service as Director (Research and Innovation) in disaster resilience and emergency management policy.Brenton was alsoChief of Staff to a 'balance of power' Senator during the global financial crisis. In this role, he supported the handling of all legislation before federal parliament and worked directly with senior and shadow ministers and their staff. Based on these experiences, he has published a guide on shaping policy within minority government contexts. Together, this experience underpins his passion for teaching and degree supervision with pre-service and in-service policy leaders.Brenton’s previous academic roles include Senior Research Fellow in a UK Russell Group impact centre where he worked with officers in Westminster to improve the impact of academic research on policy. He has also held Senior Lecturer positions in sociology and teacher education. As part of this, he co-led an Australian Research Council linkage project to support community capacity building and place-based responses through schools in some of Australia's poorest communities.Recognition of Brenton’s service to the community extends back to 1997 when he was the Young South Australian of the Year and was a finalist in the Young Australian of the Year awards.Brenton has published over 60 peer reviewed publications and presented across 4 continents. He has had over 90,000 people read his contributions to the research translation site, the Conversation, while his handbook on ADHD sold over 6,000 copies internationally.He is currently an honorary senior research fellow at the Australian National University and adjunct Associate Professor in the School of Medicine at Notre Dame University.",Canberra00008,Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance,"Dr Selen Ercan is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance, University of Canberra.

For the past 20 years she has worked with a broad range of communities in Australia and the Asia-Pacific, engaging in qualitative and participatory social research for community learning and development.Katharine’s research is driven by a curiosity about how our human communities structure efforts to act upon the world, and, in particular, to transform it for the better. Efforts to better the world take place in many different contexts and the professionalisation of these efforts is well established in the fields of community development, social enterprise, agronomy, health and education. Her current research considers questions of: how to achieve gender equity in ways that suit the lives and livelihoods of people in their different places and communities; how to reshape enterprises and organisations around priorities of care and inclusivity; and how to put an ethics of care for people and environment at the heart of economies and livelihoods.Katharine has published extensively on topics of community learning and development, and economies of care. Her most recent book, Birthing Work: The Collective Labour of Childbirth highlights the human and more-than-human interdependence that is at the foundation of family life and livelihood. Her work on community development practice in northern Thailand is published as a monograph in Development Professionals in Northern Thailand: Hope, Politics and Practice (2012).

He held previous professorial posts at Manchester and Strathclyde. Professor Stoker’s main research interests are in governance, democratic politics, local and regional governance, urban politics, public participation and public service reform. He has authored or edited over 20 books and published over 70 refereed articles or chapters in books. Professor Stoker was the founding Chair of the New Local Government Network which won the UK think tank of the year in 2004 and his most recent book ‘Why Politics Matters’ won the 2006 political book of the year award from the Political Studies Association of the UK. Professor Stoker has provided advice to various parts of the UK government and is also an expert advisor to the Council of Europe on local government and participation issues. In 2004, he won the Political Studies Association Award for ‘making a difference’ in recognition of the impact of his work on governance issues.It was in the area of urban politics and local government studies that Professor Stoker first made his name and continues to be seen as a leading authority. He has been a prolific publisher in this area notably The Politics of Local Government, Local Government in Europe, Theories of Urban Politics and Rethinking Local Democracy. For five years (1992-7) Professor Stoker was Programme Director of a £2m research endeavour run for the UK’s Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC) under the title of the Local Governance Programme. Two edited books captured the main output of the programme The New Management of Local Governance and The New Politics of Local Governance. A single authored book Transforming Local Governance on the reforms undertaken by New Labour was published in early 2004 and later that year an edited book on British Local Government into the 21st Century emerged that analyzed New Labour’s reform in more detail. From April 2002 Professor Stoker has been heading up the major Government funded five-year evaluation of the new constitutional and standard arrangements introduced into local government in the UK by the 2000 Local Government Act (see www.elgnce.org.uk for research reports and publications). In more normative vein he has been a strong advocate of a new localism and a greater devolution in the approach to governance both in the UK and beyond.A further theme of Professor Stoker’s work has been his interest with citizen participation, social capital and civil renewal. This work led to the development of a heuristic to help public authorities investigate their public participation strategies and identify how they might be improved. The Council of Europe has adopted this CLEAR framework and used it in a range of municipal settings throughout Europe. More recently, Gerry’s focus has been on understanding the changing nature of citizen participation in a range of country settings including Australia. Indeed, he will help meet the Institute’s aim of designing and analysing unique data sets on the qualities of Australian democracy and (where appropriate) processes of democratisation internationally.",Canberra00123,"Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society","Jean-Paul Gagnon is a philosopher of democracy specializing in democratic theory.

Her current research considers questions of: how to achieve gender equity in ways that suit the lives and livelihoods of people in their different places and communities; how to reshape enterprises and organisations around priorities of care and inclusivity; and how to put an ethics of care for people and environment at the heart of economies and livelihoods.Katharine has published extensively on topics of community learning and development, and economies of care. Her most recent book, Birthing Work: The Collective Labour of Childbirth highlights the human and more-than-human interdependence that is at the foundation of family life and livelihood. Her work on community development practice in northern Thailand is published as a monograph in Development Professionals in Northern Thailand: Hope, Politics and Practice (2012).

I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010).

She has been one of the key researchers who developed the Child and Youth Social Exclusion Index at a small area level in Australia. Both Child and Youth Social Exclusion Indices have been used by policy makers such as the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) and also by service providers such as the Red Cross and ACOSS.Mira has led many research projects in the area of wellbeing of older adults including developing a new conceptual framework to understand well-being of older adults taking into account location and mobility. This work has been extended to estimate the prevalence of social exclusion of older adults in Australia. Recently, Mira was the co-author of an AMP.NATSEM Income and Wealth Report entitled ‘Going the distance: working longer, living healthier’ which examines the relationship between health and working in later life and was co-author of two other reports in this field namely: ‘Small area Indicators of Wellbeing for Older Australians (IWOA)’, a report for the Benevolent Society and ’Index of Educational Advantage (IdEA)’, a report for the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training. Mira was also the Chief Investigator representing the UC team for the ARC Linkage (LP120100624) – ‘Understanding and preventing workforce vulnerabilities in mid-life and beyond’.",Canberra00087,"Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society","Dr Michael de Percy FCILT is Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the Canberra School of Politics, Economics, and Society, University of Canberra.

In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others.

Much of this work related to Australian rural policy and I therefore have a deep practical understanding of this policy field.I was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 2015.",Canberra00039,Psychology,"OVERVIEWI am a transdisciplinary social scientist who lectures and researches at the University of Canberra. I am a Sylff Fellow (Ryoichi Sasakwa Young Leaders Fellowship, Tokyo & Nippon Foundation), a research fellow at the Joint Centre for Disaster Research (Massey University, NZ), and an international associate at the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research (Victoria University, NZ).I am the co-founder and former Deputy Chair of the Group of Energy Efficient Researchers (GEER) Australia.My research interest is human adaptation and transformation. I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010). Since 2007, I am reviewing academic papers for various international disaster, migration, and research design journals.

Canberra00080,0.022334209619543258,Canberra00039,Centre for Change Governance,"I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, at the University of Canberra. My current research explores the role and mechanisms for more participatory forms of governance within rural and regional communities. This includes (i) understanding the socio-political community context, including existing power relations, networks and institutions; (ii) identifying current governance arrangements and the strengths and weaknesses, including existing forms of participation across the community; iii) identifying, often in collaboration with communities, how to support positive community engagement processes in policy governance, industry and NRM contexts, and (iv) communicating the diversity of research findings into outcomes accessible by a range of audiences including policy-makers, community members and stakeholders. I have undertaken a range of projects across water management, community development, forest management and agricultural sectors.Specifically, my academic interests focus on:Community engagement strategy development and training for the forest sector and other stakeholders including NRM agencies and local government.Improving engagement between communities, decision makers and experts to promote effective decision making.Governance within regional communities. Understanding the differences between communities and how to work with communities for sustainable futures. I undertake this work in both communities and industry-based sectors.Environmental governance and its interface with national policy agendas.I was a Schlich Medallist at the Australian National University, where I completed undergraduate degree in Science (Forestry) (Honours First Class) in 1998.

Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010). Since 2007, I am reviewing academic papers for various international disaster, migration, and research design journals. I have been awarded numerous national and international scholarships and fellowships.RESEARCH PROJECTSYearResearch Project, Role & Team 2003Individual and social factors constraining preparation for tsunami hazardsResearch Assistant, Washington State Government, USA Research team members: Professor Douglas Paton (UTAS, Australia), Dr David Johnson (GNS, NZ), Dr Kevin Ronan (Massey University, NZ), George Crawford (US National Tsunami Programme)2004 - 05Risk management for natural hazards - bushfiresResearch Assistant, University of Tasmania and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), AustraliaResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), Dr Gail Kelly (CSIRO)2007 - 09Psychosocial factors influencing individual and community preparedness for avian flu pandemicPrincipal Researcher, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, New ZealandResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia) and A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research)2011 - 12Community level influence on individual behaviours with respect to bushfire readiness and decision making Post-doctorial Research Associate, University of Western Australia, Australia and Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (Bushfire CRC)Research team members: W/Professor David Morrison, W/Professor Carmen Lawrence, Professor Timothy Skinner, Professor Colin McCleod, Dr Lies Notebart, Dr Illy McNeil, and Patrick Dunlop2012 - 14Housing and neighbourhoods that generate social inclusion, economic opportunities and wellbeingResearcher, University of Western Australia, Business School, Centre for Social ImpactResearch Team: Professor Paul Flatau (UWA), A/Professor Paul Maginn (UWA) and A/Professor Val Colic-Peisker (RMIT)2014 - 16Community understanding of the tsunami risk and warnings systems in Australian communitiesResearcher, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC Research group members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research), Katelyn Rossiter (University of Tasmania, Australia)2014 - 16“Dharray manymakkuŋ pawaw ga gapuw*” – Manymak Energy Efficiency Project with Indigenous Communities in East Arnhem LandPrincipal Researcher & Evaluator, Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods,Research Team: A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Professor Tim Skinner, Julia Becker, A/Professor Simon Moss, A/Prof Anne Lowell, Mirza Baig (CDU)Project Team: Federal Department of Industries, Power and Water Cooperation, Northern Territory Government Department of Housing, Centre for Appropriate Technology, East Arnhem Regional Council2016 -Northern Australian Bushfire and Natural Hazard TrainingResearcher & Evaluator, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC & CDU Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods Research team members: Steve Sudden (CDU, RIEL), Dr Bev Sithole (ARPNet), various Indigenous Researchers from ARPNet, Iolante Sudden2017-2018Arts Related Disaster Risk Reduction: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Artist’s Cultural Knowledge & Skills Exchange and CreationsPrincipal Investigator – project leaderResearch team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni Lee, A/Prof Ioannis Michaloudis, Dr Benxiang Zeng, Dr Michelle Moss, Dr Jelena Zeleskov Doric (all CDU but different disciplines)2018-2019Using Arts to heal, reduce the risk of disasters and adapt to climate change: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Cultural Knowledge and Skills Exchange and Creation Principal Investigator – project leaderInternational research team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni D.

I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health.

Canberra00360,0.015445029655835163,Canberra00039,Centre for Change Governance,"Associate Professor Schirmer leads the Regional Wellbeing Survey, an annual survey examining the views of 13,000 rural and regional Australians about the liveability and resilience of their community, and their own wellbeing and resilience. It covers topics ranging from understanding how to support carers living in the bush, to identifying the impacts of poor internet connectivity, and understanding how events such as droughts, floods and environmental policy change affect rural communities. In addition to leading the Regional Wellbeing Survey, Jacki's personal research interests focus on understanding the social dimensions of natural resource management, particularly how people's access to and use of natural resources affects their health and wellbeing. Her work in recent years has focused on (i) analysing the social impacts of changes in management of natural resources such as forests, fisheries and water on workers and rural communities, (ii) understanding the factors that drive conflict over natural resource management and which affect social acceptability of environmental policy and practice, and (iii) understanding how to achieve greater adoption of pro-environmental behaviours.",Canberra00039,Psychology,"OVERVIEWI am a transdisciplinary social scientist who lectures and researches at the University of Canberra. I am a Sylff Fellow (Ryoichi Sasakwa Young Leaders Fellowship, Tokyo & Nippon Foundation), a research fellow at the Joint Centre for Disaster Research (Massey University, NZ), and an international associate at the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research (Victoria University, NZ).I am the co-founder and former Deputy Chair of the Group of Energy Efficient Researchers (GEER) Australia.My research interest is human adaptation and transformation. I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010). Since 2007, I am reviewing academic papers for various international disaster, migration, and research design journals. I have been awarded numerous national and international scholarships and fellowships.RESEARCH PROJECTSYearResearch Project, Role & Team 2003Individual and social factors constraining preparation for tsunami hazardsResearch Assistant, Washington State Government, USA Research team members: Professor Douglas Paton (UTAS, Australia), Dr David Johnson (GNS, NZ), Dr Kevin Ronan (Massey University, NZ), George Crawford (US National Tsunami Programme)2004 - 05Risk management for natural hazards - bushfiresResearch Assistant, University of Tasmania and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), AustraliaResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), Dr Gail Kelly (CSIRO)2007 - 09Psychosocial factors influencing individual and community preparedness for avian flu pandemicPrincipal Researcher, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, New ZealandResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia) and A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research)2011 - 12Community level influence on individual behaviours with respect to bushfire readiness and decision making Post-doctorial Research Associate, University of Western Australia, Australia and Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (Bushfire CRC)Research team members: W/Professor David Morrison, W/Professor Carmen Lawrence, Professor Timothy Skinner, Professor Colin McCleod, Dr Lies Notebart, Dr Illy McNeil, and Patrick Dunlop2012 - 14Housing and neighbourhoods that generate social inclusion, economic opportunities and wellbeingResearcher, University of Western Australia, Business School, Centre for Social ImpactResearch Team: Professor Paul Flatau (UWA), A/Professor Paul Maginn (UWA) and A/Professor Val Colic-Peisker (RMIT)2014 - 16Community understanding of the tsunami risk and warnings systems in Australian communitiesResearcher, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC Research group members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research), Katelyn Rossiter (University of Tasmania, Australia)2014 - 16“Dharray manymakkuŋ pawaw ga gapuw*” – Manymak Energy Efficiency Project with Indigenous Communities in East Arnhem LandPrincipal Researcher & Evaluator, Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods,Research Team: A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Professor Tim Skinner, Julia Becker, A/Professor Simon Moss, A/Prof Anne Lowell, Mirza Baig (CDU)Project Team: Federal Department of Industries, Power and Water Cooperation, Northern Territory Government Department of Housing, Centre for Appropriate Technology, East Arnhem Regional Council2016 -Northern Australian Bushfire and Natural Hazard TrainingResearcher & Evaluator, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC & CDU Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods Research team members: Steve Sudden (CDU, RIEL), Dr Bev Sithole (ARPNet), various Indigenous Researchers from ARPNet, Iolante Sudden2017-2018Arts Related Disaster Risk Reduction: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Artist’s Cultural Knowledge & Skills Exchange and CreationsPrincipal Investigator – project leaderResearch team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni Lee, A/Prof Ioannis Michaloudis, Dr Benxiang Zeng, Dr Michelle Moss, Dr Jelena Zeleskov Doric (all CDU but different disciplines)2018-2019Using Arts to heal, reduce the risk of disasters and adapt to climate change: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Cultural Knowledge and Skills Exchange and Creation Principal Investigator – project leaderInternational research team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni D.

In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010). Since 2007, I am reviewing academic papers for various international disaster, migration, and research design journals. I have been awarded numerous national and international scholarships and fellowships.RESEARCH PROJECTSYearResearch Project, Role & Team 2003Individual and social factors constraining preparation for tsunami hazardsResearch Assistant, Washington State Government, USA Research team members: Professor Douglas Paton (UTAS, Australia), Dr David Johnson (GNS, NZ), Dr Kevin Ronan (Massey University, NZ), George Crawford (US National Tsunami Programme)2004 - 05Risk management for natural hazards - bushfiresResearch Assistant, University of Tasmania and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), AustraliaResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), Dr Gail Kelly (CSIRO)2007 - 09Psychosocial factors influencing individual and community preparedness for avian flu pandemicPrincipal Researcher, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, New ZealandResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia) and A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research)2011 - 12Community level influence on individual behaviours with respect to bushfire readiness and decision making Post-doctorial Research Associate, University of Western Australia, Australia and Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (Bushfire CRC)Research team members: W/Professor David Morrison, W/Professor Carmen Lawrence, Professor Timothy Skinner, Professor Colin McCleod, Dr Lies Notebart, Dr Illy McNeil, and Patrick Dunlop2012 - 14Housing and neighbourhoods that generate social inclusion, economic opportunities and wellbeingResearcher, University of Western Australia, Business School, Centre for Social ImpactResearch Team: Professor Paul Flatau (UWA), A/Professor Paul Maginn (UWA) and A/Professor Val Colic-Peisker (RMIT)2014 - 16Community understanding of the tsunami risk and warnings systems in Australian communitiesResearcher, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC Research group members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research), Katelyn Rossiter (University of Tasmania, Australia)2014 - 16“Dharray manymakkuŋ pawaw ga gapuw*” – Manymak Energy Efficiency Project with Indigenous Communities in East Arnhem LandPrincipal Researcher & Evaluator, Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods,Research Team: A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Professor Tim Skinner, Julia Becker, A/Professor Simon Moss, A/Prof Anne Lowell, Mirza Baig (CDU)Project Team: Federal Department of Industries, Power and Water Cooperation, Northern Territory Government Department of Housing, Centre for Appropriate Technology, East Arnhem Regional Council2016 -Northern Australian Bushfire and Natural Hazard TrainingResearcher & Evaluator, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC & CDU Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods Research team members: Steve Sudden (CDU, RIEL), Dr Bev Sithole (ARPNet), various Indigenous Researchers from ARPNet, Iolante Sudden2017-2018Arts Related Disaster Risk Reduction: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Artist’s Cultural Knowledge & Skills Exchange and CreationsPrincipal Investigator – project leaderResearch team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni Lee, A/Prof Ioannis Michaloudis, Dr Benxiang Zeng, Dr Michelle Moss, Dr Jelena Zeleskov Doric (all CDU but different disciplines)2018-2019Using Arts to heal, reduce the risk of disasters and adapt to climate change: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Cultural Knowledge and Skills Exchange and Creation Principal Investigator – project leaderInternational research team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni D.

Dr Muminovic received her Ph.D. from Keio University, Japan in 2013. Prior to joining the University of Canberra, Dr Muminovic was lecturer at State University of Novi Pazar in Serbia (2008-2010), Teaching Assistant at Keio University, Japan (2010-2013) and Research Assistant at the Global COE Program, High-Level Global Cooperation for Leading-Edge Platform on Access Spaces at Keio University, Japan (2011-2012). Dr Muminovic was Course Co-convenor: Bachelor of Arts in Architecture, University of Canberra (2014-2015).Specializing in architectural and urban design, place identity and sustainable architecture, Dr Muminovic’s research focuses on capturing and understanding the complex aspects of built environment with particular focus on transformations which maintain place identities. Taking a case study approach, coupled with lived experience from Europe to South East Asia, with particular focus on Japan, interdisciplinary collaboration, Dr Muminovic aims to understand degrees and types of change, ways of mapping, subjective and objective, capturing slippery aspects of built environment. In 2012, she was part of the team that won the first prize at the International Design Competition for the ‘Next generation sustainable house’ in Taiki-cho, Hokkaido, Japan which was built and continues to serve as the platform for research on sustainable materials and bioclimatic design in extreme climates.

Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8).

My work is trans-disciplinary and concerns how information (including metrics, economics, accounting and statistics) is used within legal and political processes, which explores the interface of law and regulation within government, public policy, corporate, regulatory and litigation settings. Traditionally, information is presented in legal and political environments as apolitical, objective and capable of resolving problems and conflicts. My research investigates the politics of 'information', depicting the role of information at methodological, technical, and political levels.I draw on a range of post-structural theory in my work, including Laclau and Mouffe, Hardt and Negri, Lazzarato, Gramsci, Luxemburg, Marx, and have a deep interest in jurisprudential theory, research philosophy and post-colonial literatures.

For the past 20 years she has worked with a broad range of communities in Australia and the Asia-Pacific, engaging in qualitative and participatory social research for community learning and development.Katharine’s research is driven by a curiosity about how our human communities structure efforts to act upon the world, and, in particular, to transform it for the better. Efforts to better the world take place in many different contexts and the professionalisation of these efforts is well established in the fields of community development, social enterprise, agronomy, health and education. Her current research considers questions of: how to achieve gender equity in ways that suit the lives and livelihoods of people in their different places and communities; how to reshape enterprises and organisations around priorities of care and inclusivity; and how to put an ethics of care for people and environment at the heart of economies and livelihoods.Katharine has published extensively on topics of community learning and development, and economies of care. Her most recent book, Birthing Work: The Collective Labour of Childbirth highlights the human and more-than-human interdependence that is at the foundation of family life and livelihood. Her work on community development practice in northern Thailand is published as a monograph in Development Professionals in Northern Thailand: Hope, Politics and Practice (2012). She has contributed to several key texts in her field, including The Handbook of Diverse Economies, Postdevelopment in Practice, Sage Handbook of Human Geography and the Blackwell A Companion to Social Geography.

I am a Sylff Fellow (Ryoichi Sasakwa Young Leaders Fellowship, Tokyo & Nippon Foundation), a research fellow at the Joint Centre for Disaster Research (Massey University, NZ), and an international associate at the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research (Victoria University, NZ).I am the co-founder and former Deputy Chair of the Group of Energy Efficient Researchers (GEER) Australia.My research interest is human adaptation and transformation. I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010).

Traditionally, with respect environmental, social and inclusion discourses, businesses tend to treat these issues as a form of ‘return on investment’ for business to engage with these discourses, they do so, but the nature of the engagement is subject to challenge. My research investigates the politics of businesses within public and private sector contexts at methodological, technical and political levels. My research is informed by post-structural theory, including Laclau and Mouffe, Gramsci, Derrida, Butler, Baudrillard, Foucault, Žižek and I have a strong interest in feminist and post-colonial theories.My current work is divided into three projects: a) corporate social responsibility and sustainability – involving a deeper understanding of the meanings of sustainability and the politics of sustainability for business and its appropriation of knowledge. In some extent, this project expands the implications of the technologies of governance and discusses issues such as corruption, fraud, political campaigns and marketing with a special focus on Brazil; b) financial accounting and regulation – including discussing the influence of neoliberal and post-colonial policies on financial accounting standards, regulation of auditing and the impacts on businesses and societies; c) diversity – including understanding initiatives and politics concerning diversity in the corporate space, including issues of sexuality, gender, identity and intersectionality.

Darren is an ecosystem and community ecologist with broad interests in the relationships between biodiversity, food-web structure, and the functioning of ecosystems.Darren’s applied research seeks to understand how environmental changes and management decisions influence freshwater, riparian, and floodplain habitats. He studies how land-use and climate change affect biological community structure and organic matter storage and dynamics in river and lakes. For instance, his work has shown that replanting native riparian vegetation along Australian agricultural streams improves stream health by restoring links between the terrestrial and aquatic environment. He has also used lake enclosures to experimentally demonstrate how extreme storms can induce algal blooms that drastically increase rates of lake primary production and respiration.Darren is currently working with a range of stakeholders in the Murray-Darling Basin to develop models for predicting how environmental flows influence the functioning of river ecosystems at broad spatial scales.",Canberra00223,Science,Associate Professor Mark Lintermans is a freshwater scientist with more than 30 years’ experience in fisheries research and management.

In particular, how do species originating from elsewhere arrive, establish and spread at new locations. The answers to these questions are critical to managing the problems posed by introduced weeds and pests. In addition, species introductions provide unique opportunities to test fundamental questions about the way ecological communities are sturctured.We use a varitey of approaches to answer these questions ranging from glasshouse experiments to large-scale field studies, all underpinned by theory and strong quantitative methods.",Canberra00122,Science,Conservation/population genetics and ecology.
