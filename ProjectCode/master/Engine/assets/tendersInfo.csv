To achieve the objectives of the strategy, the Department is developing a series of measures. One of these measures is to gather market indicators and understand the interest, drivers and objectives of research and development (R&D) of non-traditional uses of high-emissions commodities, such as coal. This falls under the strategy’s objective to support industry partnerships and research and development that support the commercialisation of alternative uses for high-emissions resources and processes.\xa0 \xa0 The resources sector remains a major contributor to the country’s prosperity and economic wellbeing. Coal, in particular will continue to play an important role in the world’s energy mix for years to come. The International Energy Agency projects coal demand in developing economies, particularly in Asia, to remain strong in the short to medium term to 2030 (Global Resources Statement, 2021). However, changes to the global energy mix are projected, and opportunities also exist to invest in research, development and commercialisation of alternative uses for high-emissions resources, including coal. As an example, the Government is committed to a technology-led approach to lowering emissions through projects such as the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain pilot project. This project when combined with Carbon Capture and Storage, has the potential to create a high value, low emissions use for Australia’s abundant brown coal reserves.\xa0 \xa0 Accordingly, the Department would like to invite suitably qualified consultants to submit a tender to provide market analysis on further research that is being undertaken into high value, low emissions uses of coal and develop a detailed insights report.\xa0\xa0 \xa0', 'Conditions for Participation': '1.The tenderer and any subcontractors proposed in the tender must not be named as not complying with the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth). 2.The tenderer confirms that in dealing with its employees and independent contractors, the tenderer has due regard to Commonwealth policies on the engagement of workers, comply with Commonwealth policies on the engagement of workers, including the obligations under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth) and relevant work health and safety laws. 3.The tenderer and any subcontractors proposed in the tender are not insolvent, bankrupt, in liquidation, or under administration or receivership.

Adoption of these HWSC systems is increasing in the Southern Region and grain growers are observing an increase of invertebrates in paddocks where the HWSC chaff is present and there is concern to the potential risk of associated crop damage. Further adoption of HWSC systems may be deterred by the unknown impact of invertebrate pests in subsequent crops. A GRDC research investment in WA (DAW1904-009RTX) determined that the geographic location of the paddock with chaff, influenced the abundance and composition of invertebrates, and that the presence of HWSC chaff increased the number of pest and natural enemy invertebrates present. This investment will quantify and interpret the pest and natural enemy invertebrate populations that harbour in the chaff residue of the HWSC systems; chaff lining, chaff tramlining and chaff piles and assess the associated crop damage. The research will be conducted in representative locations across GRDC Southern rainfall zones. Investment\xa0\xa0description  This investment will expand the understanding of the species and the population numbers of invertebrate pests and natural enemies that harbour in HWSC chaff residue of GRDC's Southern region and assess the associated crop damage. The research outcomes will inform future initiatives on management of crop pests and address potential barriers to HWSC systems adoption by quantifying the risk to crop from invertebrate pests. GRDC now seek to approach the market for a suitable applicant to provide applied field research and entomology expertise in invertebrate diagnostics and ecology. *SAGI South are available for consultation during the development of your tender. Outcome  By March 2024, growers and advisors of GRDC Southern rainfall zone will have access to current information on invertebrate pests and beneficial species harbouring in HWSC chaff residue system and the associated crop damage risk. This knowledge will lead to an increased confidence in adoption of appropriate HWSC techniques to manage weeds. Outputs  Output 1 \xa0-\xa0\xa0By March 2024 growers and advisors will have access to current information on invertebrate pests and beneficial species harbouring in HWSC chaff residue systems in the GRDC Southern region. Description: Surveillance of pest and beneficial invertebrate species population in 3 types of Harvest Weed Seed Control systems (chaff line, chaff tramlines and chaff cart dumps) and a control site without HWSC in representative locations across the GRDC Southern rainfall zones. Surveillance to be conducted 3 times during the season (post-harvest, seedling emergence and grain fill) over 2 seasons. Use of proven methodology from Western research investment DAW1904-009RTX and through consultation with SAGI – South on experimental design and data analysis as required. Observational survey of crop damage caused by invertebrate pests associated with HWSC chaff residue at seedling emergence and grain fill. May use data logger to capture location microclimate. Analysis and interpretation of the relationship between invertebrate biodiversity, environment and microclimate of HWSC systems to inform potential risk to crop and subsequent development of management strategies. Output\xa0\xa02 \xa0-\xa0\xa0By March 2024, delivery of a communication package stemming from the research outcomes. Description: A communications and extension plan will be developed in consultation with GRDC within the first 3 months of project commencement.

Defence recognises that due to the highly constrained size, weight and power considerations, within the context of a rapidly evolving threat environment, Personal ECM is on the edge of technical feasibility. Therefore, Defence is seeking innovative solutions for a next-generation Personal ECM system to provide protection to individual Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel.\xa0 This challenge focuses on leveraging innovative technology to provide a next generation Personal ECM system capable of delivering a high level of protection for individual ADF personnel against an evolving Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) threat, within the constraints of size, weight and power considerations (as stated below). The future deployable ADF requires a personal ECM system that is able to inhibit multiple RCIED triggers, is modular and sufficiently agile to meet changes in RCIED triggers, and be configurable to reliably operate in various environments. Next Generation Personal ECM systems must be able to counter emerging and future vulnerabilities and threats, whilst minimising impact on an individual’s mobility. Army seeks to explore improvements in Personal ECM system components (for example processing, amplifiers, antennas and batteries) that can be integrated into a single solution, and are easy to operate. Next Generation Personal ECM systems will need to be interoperable with other radio frequency (RF) and electrical systems, and able to log operational data to support exploitation. Defence encourages Respondents to collaborate broadly and/or form consortiums with industry leaders in ECM system componentry in an effort to achieve the maximum technological potential. Proposals should demonstrate a pathway for how technical upgrades will be achieved to ensure that the Personal ECM system maintains relevance to an evolving threat environment. Defence considers the following design goals to be of particular importance in the design of a Personal ECM system: 1.\xa0 \xa0 ADF individuals need to be protected against the widest possible range of commercial radio-controlled triggered threats, with minimal impact to their tactical mobility. This means consideration be given to the size, weight and power constraints of the proposed system. Defence considers that a total weight of 1-2kg is ideal; however, Defence will consider other options that can demonstrate there will be minimal impact to mobility. 2.\xa0 \xa0 RCIED threats are constantly evolving as adversaries seek to exploit the rapid advance of commercial telecommunications and recreational technologies in order to gain an advantage over the ADF. Solutions that are offered need to consider how the system will be upgraded, in terms of both hardware and software, over the proposed life of type of the system. 3.\xa0 \xa0 ADF individuals will perform a variety of tasks whilst under the protection of Personal ECM. The solutions offered need to consider the ease of use of the system by an operator, including the ability to quickly identify that the system is operational and the ability to rapidly load different RCIED defeat protocols/waveforms. The focus of this Challenge Statement is Personal ECM. Defence recognises that due to the highly constrained size, weight and power considerations, within the context of a rapidly evolving threat environment, Personal ECM is on the edge of technical feasibility. Therefore, Defence is seeking innovative solutions for a next-generation Personal ECM system to provide protection to individual AD personnel. Technologically Mature Products Defence would prefer proposals based on products that are at a reasonable technological maturity, i.e. at TRL 4 (component and/or breadboard laboratory validated) to TRL 6 (system adequacy validated in a simulated environment).

EOI to assist with the delivery of More effective control of pest molluscs (snails and slugs) in Australian grain crops,EOI,"{'ATM ID': 'EOI', 'Agency': 'Grains Research and Development Corporation', 'Category': '70140000 - Crop production and management and protection', 'Close Date & Time': '26-Oct-2021 5:00 pm (ACT Local Time) Show close time for other time zones', 'Publish Date': '17-Aug-2021', 'Location': 'ACT, NSW, VIC, SA, WA, QLD, NT, TAS  Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart', 'ATM Type': 'Expression of Interest', 'Multi Agency Access': 'No', 'Panel Arrangement': 'No', 'Multi-stage': 'No', 'Description': 'Background Several exotic snail and slug species of European origin have established in Australian cropping regions and become significant pests of grain crops. Slugs and snails attack seedling crops, resulting in plant damage and yield impacts and losses associated with the costs of resowing and field control. Snails, additionally, climb crop plants in spring and contaminate the grain harvest, creating significant harvest costs (harvester modifications, damage to machinery, post-harvest grain cleaning) and losses (grain value downgrades, receival rejections) for affected growers, and pose serious market access risks for the industry. Mollusc management consists of an integrated, year-round approach comprising cultural, mechanical, and chemical (baiting) methods, including: physical control methods prior to crop sowing (e.g., stubble burning, slashing, rolling, cabling and grazing), chemical control methods prior to crop harvest (e.g., baiting in the field with approved chemicals) and physical control methods at or after harvest (e.g., use of a modified header, grain cleaning).  Research on the impact of snails in the grains industry has occurred since the 1980s, and GRDC has a history of investment in novel approaches to mollusc control, some of which are ongoing. \xa0  Early work focused on biology and ecology (in permanent pastures, in pasture-cereal rotations, and some limited work in continuous cropping rotations), developing engineering solutions, improving baiting efficacy, and the introduction of a parasitoid fly. Some aspects of the integrated control program (stubble bashing, stubble burning, tillage, grazing, header modifications) developed and adopted during the 1990s and 2000s, have become less practical since the adoption of no-till farming. More recent research has led to new information and more refined guidelines to assist growers to maximise the cost-effectiveness of molluscicidal baiting programs. Collective research efforts have led to the development and adoption of improved integrated control programmes and some very promising approaches for further research. However, even when performed exceptionally well, best practice management does not always reduce mollusc pressures significantly. The development of improved management tactics for snails and slugs remains a priority to improve growers’ profitability and ensure Australia’s market access is maintained. Respondents are to consider opportunities to develop new knowledge and diverse approaches that can be implemented effectively for monitoring and managing slugs and snails, including improved physical, cultural, chemical, and biological tools and technologies, to minimise losses and maximise market opportunities. Respondents could consider opportunities to:  Improve knowledge and understanding of mollusc biology and ecology to identify and exploit weaknesses and vulnerabilities in their lifecycles to maximise baiting effectiveness and achieve better management outcomes. Explore potential new formulations/actives/delivery systems, including molecules from novel sources, for their potential as molluscides, attractants or repellents, in conjunction with commercial partners where relevant. Use knowledge of mollusc movement and behaviour to evaluate physical approaches (e.g., trap crops, barriers, aggregation mechanisms and traps) to exclude and/or concentrate molluscs for targeted management. \xa0 Explore the relative palatability of different crops and varieties to herbivory by pest molluscs to identify opportunity crops/rotations/break crops that could be used strategically to reduce the impact of pest molluscs. Quantify the effects of using strategic physical/cultural approaches (incl. burning/cultivation/cabling) in different farming systems and whether sustained, economic benefits can be realised to reduce mollusc pressure. Explore opportunities for tools and technologies to detect, identify, quantify and determine special/temporal distribution of molluscs in paddock and at harvest to inform targeted management actions including removal/segregation of snails. Investigate best bet options for precision detection and engineering solutions for removal/separation that target snails along the supply chain, in conjunction with key industry and/or commercial partners. The focus of this EOI is the development of well-timed, integrated management approaches for slugs and snails that deliver multiple benefits to Australian grain growers and advisers by enabling them to minimise control failures, maximise market opportunities and derive sustained benefits that consider the seasonal threats posed by these pests. For the strategies to be readily adopted and implemented successfully, Respondents could consider opportunities to: Understand the influence of climate variability and farming systems changes on the pest status of molluscs (seasonal and paddock risk). Enable accurate forecasting of mollusc activity to maximise baiting efficacy and increase grower confidence in the proactive implementation of management strategies using understanding of the environmental triggers for mollusc movement and seasonal activity patterns. Provide growers and advisers with an understanding of the percentage control targets for snails and slugs to inform the true impacts and economic benefits of baiting and other field control operations. Provide growers and advisers with an understanding of the economics and feasibility of different physical/cultural practices that are available in the paddock and at harvest to inform decision making. Measure grower practice change to determine levels of adoption and any barriers to best practice management.', 'Conditions for Participation': ""Full details of the EOI, conditions of participation\xa0 and\xa0 evaluation criteria can be found on the GRDC website under 'other opportunities' on the tenders page."", 'Timeframe for Delivery': 'It is anticipated that this will be a 4 year activity', 'Address for Lodgement': 'Enquiries in relation to this EOI must be submitted to the email address of the Document Contact and Enquiries by the Deadline for Submission of Respondent Enquiries to be accepted.
