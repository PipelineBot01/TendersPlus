Regan Ashby,,,Canberra,Science,Associate Professor,"Regan graduated with his PhD in Medical Science from the Australian National University in 2007, under the supervision of Professor Ian Morgan. After completing his PhD, Regan received a two year Early Career Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Tuebingen, Germany, as part of the European Union, Marie-Curie European Training Program, with Dr Marita Feldkaemper and Professor Frank Schaeffel. On returning to Australia, Regan took up a lecturing position at the University of Canberra in 2011 before accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty in 2012. He now heads the Visual Neuroscience Group within the Centre for Research into Therapeutic Solutions (Health Research Institute).Regan's research focuses on the molecular pathways underlying the regulation of normal ocular growth, and how such neural pathways are affected during the development of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness). Myopia is now at epidemic proportion in many parts of the world, most notably in urban East Asia, where 80-90% of school-leavers are myopic. Recently, Regan’s research has shown that exposure to bright light levels; similar to that experienced by being outdoors, can prevent the development of experimental myopia in animal models. This protection appears to be driven by light-induced increases in the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the eye. This work has culminated in Regan being awarded the prestigious Attempto Prize for Neuroscience, from the University of Tuebingen, Germany (2010), and the Carl Zeiss Young Investigators Award in Vision Science (2013). Regan's current research looks at better understanding the genomic and epigenomic regulatory mechanisms by which exposure to high light levels can retard the development of myopia.Research interestsInvestigating the underlying causes of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness)Genomic/epigenomic regulation of ocular growthRetinal neural development",Myopia<weight>100%<bk>Eye<weight>32%<bk>Lenses<weight>32%<bk>Chickens<weight>24%<bk>Growth<weight>22%<bk>Light<weight>21%<bk>Levodopa<weight>19%<bk>Dopamine<weight>19%<bk>Bees<weight>17%<bk>Retina<weight>13%<bk>Honey<weight>13%<bk>RNA<weight>10%<bk>ADTN<weight>8%<bk>Social Class<weight>8%<bk>Carbidopa<weight>7%<bk>MicroRNAs<weight>7%<bk>Swainsonine<weight>7%<bk>Mannosidases<weight>7%<bk>Atropine<weight>7%<bk>Animals<weight>7%<bk>Amacrine Cells<weight>6%<bk>Refractive Errors<weight>6%<bk>Muscarinic Antagonists<weight>6%<bk>Dopamine Agonists<weight>6%<bk>Spiperone<weight>6%<bk>Animal Models<weight>5%<bk>Crystallins<weight>5%<bk>levodopa drug combination carbidopa<weight>5%<bk>Dopamine D1 Receptors<weight>5%<bk>Apis mellifera<weight>9%<bk>honey bees<weight>8%<bk>swainsonine<weight>6%<bk>mannosidases<weight>6%,Carbidopa<weight>26%<bk>levodopa drug combination carbidopa<weight>86%<bk>Myopia<weight>100%<bk>Levodopa<weight>100%<bk>Chickens<weight>79%<bk>complementarity<weight>100%<bk>microRNA<weight>85%<bk>Animals<weight>6%<bk>Conservation<weight>80%<bk>branching<weight>77%<bk>Lenses<weight>84%<bk>Pharmacology<weight>59%<bk>ADTN<weight>87%<bk>Dopamine<weight>45%<bk>Spiperone<weight>41%<bk>SCH 23390<weight>17%<bk>Bhutan<weight>33%<bk>Referral and Consultation<weight>14%<bk>Logistic Models<weight>13%<bk>Southeastern Asia<weight>12%<bk>Ophthalmic Solutions<weight>37%<bk>Intravitreal Injections<weight>30%<bk>Deuterium<weight>17%<bk>Eye<weight>50%<bk>Safety<weight>52%<bk>Theoretical Models<weight>72%<bk>Growth<weight>42%<bk>Animal Models<weight>27%<bk>Epidemics<weight>77%<bk>Causality<weight>16%<bk>Young Adult<weight>14%<bk>Degenerative Myopia<weight>14%<bk>Dopamine D1 Receptors<weight>100%<bk>Light<weight>63%<bk>ecopipam<weight>21%<bk>Retina<weight>71%<bk>caste<weight>100%<bk>honeybee<weight>99%<bk>Bees<weight>100%<bk>bee<weight>83%<bk>methylation<weight>80%<bk>Swainsonine<weight>100%<bk>Mannosidases<weight>99%<bk>swainsonine<weight>91%<bk>mannosidases<weight>86%<bk>Vision Disorders<weight>99%<bk>Antioxidants<weight>67%<bk>Neurotransmitter Agents<weight>38%<bk>Tupaiidae<weight>20%<bk>Honey<weight>99%<bk>Social Class<weight>70%<bk>MicroRNAs<weight>64%<bk>Genome<weight>20%<bk>F 4<weight>15%<bk>Direction compound<weight>100%<bk>Messenger RNA<weight>78%<bk>Animal Model<weight>100%<bk>Nonhuman Primate<weight>11%<bk>Plasticity<weight>10%<bk>Pathway<weight>8%<bk>Research Personnel<weight>63%<bk>Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists<weight>26%<bk>Refractive Errors<weight>100%<bk>Proteomics<weight>79%<bk>Glucagon<weight>100%<bk>RNA<weight>71%<bk>Crystallins<weight>100%<bk>Amacrine Cells<weight>100%<bk>Crystalline Lens<weight>47%<bk>Gene Expression<weight>45%<bk>Genes<weight>30%<bk>Dopamine Antagonists<weight>36%<bk>Sunlight<weight>27%<bk>Withholding Treatment<weight>13%<bk>Muscarinic Antagonists<weight>100%<bk>Dopamine Agonists<weight>92%

M. Selen Ayirtman Ercan,,,Canberra,Institute for Governance & Policy Analysis,Associate Professor,"Dr Selen Ercan is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance, University of Canberra. Her work sits at the intersection of normativedemocratictheory andempirical political research, and examines a wide range of topics including the politics of inclusion and exclusion in multicultural societies, the prospects for public deliberation in the face of value conflicts and polarised public debates, and the potential of new forms of political participation and protest movements in reviving democratic practice.Selen’s recent book, Mending Democracy. Democratic Repair in Disconnected Times(2020, Oxford University Press, with Hendriks and Boswell)examines how everyday citizens, community groups, politicians and public administrators respond to the crisis of representative democracy, and offer novel ways of reimagining and reforming it.Selen has published over 30 articles and book chapters on deliberative democracy, social movements, multiculturalism, and research methods in Social Sciences. Her publications have appeared in various journals including: International Political Science Review, Policy and Politics, Australian Journal of Political Science, Environmental Politics, Social Movement Studies, and Critical Policy Studies. Two of her articles won the best paper prize of the journal, Policy and Politics in 2017 and 2019. Selen holds a BA in Political Science and Public Administration (METU, Turkey), a MA in Political Science and Sociology (University of Heidelberg, Germany), and a PhD in Political Science (Australian National University). She has held research positions at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (Germany), Australian NationalUniversity; as well as visiting research and teaching positions in the Political Science programs of theFederal University of Minas Gerais (Brazil),Nagoya University (Japan) and StuttgartUniversity(Germany).Selected PublicationsErcan, S.A., Asenbaum, H., Curato, N. and Mendonça, R.F.

The project develops new knowledge through an innovative synthesis of culturalsociology and deliberative democracy to analyse nine cases of responses in the public realm to attacks.Monitoring Deliberative Integrity in AustraliaChief Investigator, Special Research Initiative Grant (2021-2024), funded by the Australian Research Council ($202,106).This project aims to develop and apply the concept of deliberative integrity as a counterpart to more familiar ideasabout electoral integrity in the evaluation of democratic processes. The project develops significant newknowledge about the ethical conduct of Australian citizen engagement processes through conceptual andmethodological innovation to produce a Deliberative Integrity Monitoring Tool that will be applied to the expandingrange of deliberative democratic innovations in Australia.Connecting to ParliamentChief Investigator, funded by University of Canberra and Ohio State University (2020-present).This project seeks to link a representative sample of constituents with their elected official in productive town hall conversations about the issues that are subject to parliamentary debate in Australia. The project seeks to involve more Australians in the democratic process, and to expand knowledge about the potential benefits and uses of deliberative democracy. For more information about this project, please visit the project website:https://connect2parliament.comDeliberative Democracy in the Face of Democratic CrisisCo-investigator, Reserach Grant (2020-2022) funded by theBrazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ($15,000).This project seeks to identify the challenges contemporary democracies face and investigate the ways deliberative perspective can help address these challenges. It focuses particularly on the changing dynamics of communication in contemporary public spheres (partly as a result of the rise of Information and Communication Technologies) and explore the implications of these changes for democracies.ParticipediaCo-investigator (2017-present), funded by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada).The Australian contingent of this project seeks to develop systematic and practical information on the variety of democratic innovations from all over Australia.The project aims to 1) comprehensively catalogue current and past participatory Australian political processes and 2) explore emergent themes and lessons from Australian cases 3) develop a future research agenda for learning across cases to provide systematic and practical advice for researchers and practitioners worldwide. These objectives feed into Participedia’s primary aims of mapping democratic innovations, explaining and assessing their contribution to democracy and most importantly, transferring this knowledge back into practice.

Nicole Beard,mailto:Nicole.Beard@canberra.edu.au,,Canberra,Science,Associate Professor,"Dr Beard and her research team investigate how intracellular calcium signaling pathways initiate muscle contraction. We explore and define the mechanisms which lead to control of calcium signalling and the way in which these are disrupted in skeletal myopathies, cardiomyopathy and heart failure.Muscle contraction occurs due to a cascade of events and relies on calcium release from intracellular stores. The four main cogs in the intracellular calcium signalling pathway are the calcium binding protein calsequestrin (CSQ), the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channel, and two linking proteins - triadin and junctin - which bind CSQ to the RyR. Control of calcium release in muscle is vital; disturbances in the process can lead to potentially fatal skeletal and cardiac conditions.Despite their essential role in skeletal muscle and the heart, the functional and structural interactions between the proteins that drive calcium signalling are poorly understood and form the broad aims of our research.Currently funded projects include:Calcium signalling by intracellular calcium stores: implications for muscle performance and athletic abilityCalcium homeostatis disturbances and human heart failureUnderstanding how chemotherapy agents cause cardiotoxicityResearch interestsHeart failureCardiomyopathySkeletal muscle ageing and myopathy",Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel<weight>26%<bk>Calsequestrin<weight>43%<bk>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum<weight>24%<bk>triadin<weight>8%<bk>Skeletal Muscle<weight>23%<bk>Calcium<weight>10%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Type III<weight>9%<bk>Excitation Contraction Coupling<weight>8%<bk>Muscular Diseases<weight>8%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Types I and II<weight>8%<bk>Myocardium<weight>8%<bk>Phosphorylation<weight>7%<bk>adriamycinol<weight>7%<bk>Anthracyclines<weight>7%<bk>Ion Channels<weight>5%<bk>Proteins<weight>6%<bk>Hereditary Angioedemas<weight>6%<bk>Oxidation-Reduction<weight>6%<bk>Heart<weight>6%<bk>Muscles<weight>5%<bk>Heart Failure<weight>5%<bk>Hot Temperature<weight>5%<bk>Graves Disease<weight>5%<bk>lipopolysaccharide-binding protein<weight>5%<bk>Muscle<weight>10%,Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins<weight>100%<bk>Hot Temperature<weight>90%<bk>Exercise<weight>76%<bk>lipopolysaccharide-binding protein<weight>77%<bk>Lipopolysaccharides<weight>36%<bk>omecamtiv mecarbil<weight>100%<bk>Norepinephrine<weight>42%<bk>Heart<weight>52%<bk>Systolic Heart Failure<weight>7%<bk>Atrial Appendage<weight>7%<bk>Permeability<weight>100%<bk>Humidity<weight>52%<bk>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum<weight>90%<bk>Heart Failure<weight>59%<bk>Calcium<weight>55%<bk>Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel<weight>100%<bk>Diastole<weight>96%<bk>Oxidation-Reduction<weight>77%<bk>Phosphorylation<weight>44%<bk>Phenotype<weight>48%<bk>Calmodulin<weight>88%<bk>tacrolimus binding protein 1B<weight>14%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Type III<weight>100%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Types I and II<weight>84%<bk>Hereditary Angioedemas<weight>69%<bk>Safety<weight>28%<bk>Ion Channel Gating<weight>100%<bk>Ventricular Fibrillation<weight>26%<bk>Polymorphic catecholergic ventricular tachycardia<weight>36%<bk>Atrial Fibrillation<weight>22%<bk>Muscle Weakness<weight>100%<bk>Actins<weight>79%<bk>Rheumatoid Arthritis<weight>77%<bk>Skeletal Muscle<weight>51%<bk>Arthritis<weight>27%<bk>Calcium Signaling<weight>95%<bk>Ion Channels<weight>79%<bk>Thymus<weight>38%<bk>Post Translational Protein Processing<weight>83%<bk>Muscle<weight>75%<bk>Myocardium<weight>53%<bk>Tacrolimus Binding Proteins<weight>19%<bk>Protein Binding<weight>67%<bk>Channelopathies<weight>9%<bk>Tacrolimus<weight>17%<bk>Excitation Contraction Coupling<weight>73%<bk>Proteins<weight>17%<bk>Pharmacology<weight>54%<bk>Muscular Diseases<weight>87%<bk>Sulfhydryl Compounds<weight>12%<bk>Homeostasis<weight>8%<bk>adriamycinol<weight>81%<bk>Calsequestrin<weight>100%<bk>Anthracyclines<weight>90%<bk>triadin<weight>100%<bk>Chemical activation<weight>50%<bk>Muscles<weight>8%<bk>Mixed Function Oxygenases<weight>8%<bk>Aspartic Acid<weight>7%<bk>L-Type Calcium Channels<weight>100%<bk>Skeletal Muscle Fibers<weight>7%<bk>Protein Isoforms<weight>19%<bk>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases<weight>100%<bk>Doxorubicin<weight>60%<bk>Cardiac Arrhythmias<weight>17%<bk>Cytoplasm<weight>65%<bk>Sheep<weight>57%<bk>Inhibition (Psychology)<weight>8%<bk>Adrenergic Agents<weight>87%<bk>calcium<weight>61%<bk>phosphorylation<weight>23%<bk>Scorpions<weight>100%<bk>Cystine<weight>90%<bk>Disulfides<weight>74%<bk>Cystine Knot Motifs<weight>34%<bk>skeletal muscle<weight>51%<bk>Cardiac Output<weight>76%<bk>Health<weight>40%<bk>Action Potentials<weight>27%<bk>Daunorubicin<weight>100%<bk>Dithiothreitol<weight>8%<bk>Knockout Mice<weight>59%<bk>Carrier Proteins<weight>54%<bk>Pharmaceutical Preparations<weight>33%<bk>Heart Diseases<weight>19%<bk>K201 compound<weight>15%<bk>Ryanodine<weight>21%<bk>Peptides<weight>20%<bk>Rabbits<weight>11%<bk>Muscle Contraction<weight>57%<bk>Muscle Proteins<weight>76%<bk>Graves Disease<weight>73%<bk>Mutation<weight>22%
