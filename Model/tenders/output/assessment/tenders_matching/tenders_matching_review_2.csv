 build the confidence and ability of employers to hire, support and retain employees with disability

 The Reconnect program is a community based early intervention and prevention program for young people aged 12 to 18 years (or?12?to?21 years in the case of newly arrived youth) who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and their families. 
 The Australian Government has announced up to $117 million for new three year funding agreements (1?July?2018 to 30?June?2021), with the option to extend funding for a further two years (subject to providers meeting performance objectives) for Reconnect service providers.?  
 The aim of Reconnect is to prevent homelessness by intervening early with families and young people to stabilise and improve their housing situation and improve their level of engagement with family, work, education, training, employment and their local community. 
 Reconnect services provide counselling, group work, mediation and practical support to the whole family, to help break the cycle of homelessness. Reconnect providers also purchase other services to meet the individual needs of clients, such as specialised mental health services. 
 From 1 July 2018, the Reconnect program will emphasise early intervention and prevention. Refocusing early intervention and prevention will mean more young people in need of assistance are identified early and have access to services before they become homeless or disengaged, and before problems compound. 
 The final amount of funding available is subject to the application of the efficiency dividend and indexation, which is determined through the Australian Government＊s Budget process. 
 As a result of this process, the Commonwealth intends to fund 102 Reconnect services.

It identifies the various factors, barriers and challenges that contribute to this increase and highlights the importance of improved data collections and systems to support a more comprehensive understanding of BBV and STI among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia. 
 The main source of information on BBV and STI among the Australian population comes from routine clinical notification data through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The NNDSS system however leaves major gaps in the understanding of epidemics, especially among priority populations like Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These gaps draw attention to the need for supplementary data that contributes to improved understanding of epidemics, impact of interventions and health care delivery against clinical guidelines. 
 The objective of the ATLAS surveillance network is to strengthen the evidence base regarding BBV＊s and STI＊s in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities, by undertaking broad surveillance and data collection activities in those communities to supplement the NNDSS. This information will be used by the Department and participating Aboriginal health services to report on, and support the achievement of, the goals and targets identified in the Indigenous BBV and STI Strategy. 
 This closed, non-competitive grant opportunity will run over two financial years (2020-21 to 2021-22), and is directed at further expansion, maintenance and integration of the ATLAS network with the aim of making ATLAS an integral component of Australia＊s public health surveillance system.",0

 The Reconnect program is a community based early intervention and prevention program for young people aged 12 to 18 years (or?12?to?21 years in the case of newly arrived youth) who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and their families. 
 The Australian Government has announced up to $117 million for new three year funding agreements (1?July?2018 to 30?June?2021), with the option to extend funding for a further two years (subject to providers meeting performance objectives) for Reconnect service providers.?  
 The aim of Reconnect is to prevent homelessness by intervening early with families and young people to stabilise and improve their housing situation and improve their level of engagement with family, work, education, training, employment and their local community. 
 Reconnect services provide counselling, group work, mediation and practical support to the whole family, to help break the cycle of homelessness. Reconnect providers also purchase other services to meet the individual needs of clients, such as specialised mental health services. 
 From 1 July 2018, the Reconnect program will emphasise early intervention and prevention. Refocusing early intervention and prevention will mean more young people in need of assistance are identified early and have access to services before they become homeless or disengaged, and before problems compound. 
 The final amount of funding available is subject to the application of the efficiency dividend and indexation, which is determined through the Australian Government＊s Budget process. 
 As a result of this process, the Commonwealth intends to fund 102 Reconnect services.
