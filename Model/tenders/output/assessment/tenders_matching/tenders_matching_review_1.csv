Over the next ten (10) to fifteen (15) years, the size and skill level of the naval shipbuilding and sustainment workforce will need to increase significantly to meet the demands created by the Government’s planned investments in naval shipbuilding.  The naval shipbuilding enterprise is too important for the market forces of supply and demand to manage growth and skilling requirements. A national approach to rebuilding the naval shipbuilding and sustainment workforce is required. On 24 March 2017, the Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP announced that the Government will establish a Naval Shipbuilding College to identify, train and retain workers for the naval shipbuilding enterprise.  The NSC project is expected to be delivered through three phases, with progress to the next phase dependent on the successful achievement of the previous phase:• the first phase will commence in 2018 and focus on establishing the NSC; is expected to build capacity and annual throughput at existing education and training institutions across Australia, in key entry level trade qualifications. It will commence a nation-wide communication program, including a career awareness program for school level audiences and workers in adjacent industries; and create a workforce register;• the second phase of the Naval Shipbuilding College is expected to commence in 2020/21. The College will continue to increase capacity and student throughput in key entry-level trades, and will build on this to also achieve increased capacity and throughput in key higher education qualifications (such as naval architecture/engineering) from universities; and• the final phase of the NSC Project could commence from around 2022-2023, subject to successful implementation of the first two phases, and is to develop and construct a purpose-built Naval Shipbuilding College training facility located at the Osborne Naval Shipyard that will offer a range of naval shipbuilding and sustainment education and training that cannot be met from existing institutions.  To support the establishment and delivery of the NSC, the Commonwealth, through the Defence of Defence, is seeking to engage with the broader training and education industry and with potential NSC providers to:• provide informed input and innovative ideas that can be considered by the Commonwealth in determining the optimal service development and delivery solution for the NSC; and• enable an industry partner or partners to be selected to deliver the first two phases of NSC outcomes.    ","Design, Development and Delivery of Investigative Interviewing Programs to the AFP",Education and Training Services,"The AFP is seeking the design, development and delivery of a four tiered model of Investigative Interviewing programs, with a 'Train the Trainer' component.

These students may be dealing with a variety of barriers to continued engagement with education or employment, such as mental health issues, or they may lack motivation to continue traditional classroom-based study. 
 To address these issues, the project uses an eight-week, intensive training program that is focused on civil construction work, and the work of other industries. The program offers practical training from qualified tradespeople in a simulated workplace. This type of training may be more desirable for young people to engage with; additionally, it exposes participants to the realities of the workplace, allowing them to be better prepared for the transition to work. The project also offers the support of a Youth Development Worker for program participants, who can help them with their more complex barriers to employment through mentoring and referrals to other appropriate services. 
 Project activities will focus on skills development and job readiness for the civil construction industry in a first site in Western Sydney. This includes work skills in civil construction as well as life skills, such as organisation and time management. A second site will apply a similar training model, but adapted for another industry, either commercial and residential construction, or landscaping. The focus on new industries at the second site will require an initial development and setup period before it can become operational. This is to ensure the model is suitable for the new industry.

 CCSs occupy a unique and important position within Australia’s family law system, with their core business focusing on the needs of children whose parents are separating or separated and who cannot manage contact arrangements. 
 CCSs enable children of separated parents to have safe contact with the parent they do not live with, in circumstances where parents are unable to manage their own contact arrangements. Where separated parents are not able to meet without conflict, CCSs provide a safe, neutral venue for the transfer of children between separated parents. Where there is a perceived or actual risk to the child, they also provide supervised contact between a child and the parent or other persons that are significant to the child whom they do not live with, where it is assessed by the service as safe to do so. 
 The objectives of the grant opportunity are to deliver a CCS that: 
 
 provides a trauma informed, child-centred model of intervention, that assists children of separated parents establish and maintain a relationship with their other parent and family members  
 helps achieve sustained and workable long-term parenting and contact arrangements.

This is an integral part of the government’s commitments to provide support for violence-prevention strategies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. 
 An important component of this work is the Dedicated Project Officer Grants Program. Grants will be made available to up to nine Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations (ACCOs) to enable the engagement of a project officer to work in consultation with eSafety in the development of frontline worker training and resources. 
 The invitation to apply for this targeted competitive grant opportunity will be made to selected ACCOs (identified through consultation with the NIAA) that operate in urban, regional and remote locations across Australia, and who specialise in domestic and family violence service provision or who are otherwise working with women in vulnerable circumstances. 
 The agencies who have been invited to apply for this grant opportunity are listed in the Dedicated Project Officer Grants Program Guidelines. 
 The DPOs thus engaged consult with eSafety in the development of a range of suitable online and offline training resources to support women and to build capacity within the community to address technology-facilitated abuse as an extension of domestic and family violence.

 DECoS is one of a number of continuity of support programs delivered by Commonwealth, state and territory governments aimed at supporting clients who are confirmed to be ineligible for the NDIS to achieve similar outcomes and are not disadvantaged in the transition to the NDIS.

 There is no option for NDIS eligible supported employees to continue receiving funded employment supports through the DEA program after 30 June 2020. The Department of Social Services and the National Disability Insurance Agency are working closely together to ensure all eligible supported employees have their NDIS plans in place by 30 June 2020.
