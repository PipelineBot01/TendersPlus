61585aa8d7b0c43ebd7551e2,Science,null,Regan Ashby,"Regan graduated with his PhD in Medical Science from the Australian National University in 2007, under the supervision of Professor Ian Morgan. After completing his PhD, Regan received a two year Early Career Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Tuebingen, Germany, as part of the European Union, Marie-Curie European Training Program, with Dr Marita Feldkaemper and Professor Frank Schaeffel. On returning to Australia, Regan took up a lecturing position at the University of Canberra in 2011 before accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty in 2012. He now heads the Visual Neuroscience Group within the Centre for Research into Therapeutic Solutions (Health Research Institute).Regan s research focuses on the molecular pathways underlying the regulation of normal ocular growth, and how such neural pathways are affected during the development of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness). Myopia is now at epidemic proportion in many parts of the world, most notably in urban East Asia, where 80-90% of school-leavers are myopic. Recently, Regan s research has shown that exposure to bright light levels; similar to that experienced by being outdoors, can prevent the development of experimental myopia in animal models. This protection appears to be driven by light-induced increases in the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the eye. This work has culminated in Regan being awarded the prestigious Attempto Prize for Neuroscience, from the University of Tuebingen, Germany (2010), and the Carl Zeiss Young Investigators Award in Vision Science (2013). Regan s current research looks at better understanding the genomic and epigenomic regulatory mechanisms by which exposure to high light levels can retard the development of myopia.Research interestsInvestigating the underlying causes of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness)Genomic/epigenomic regulation of ocular growthRetinal neural development",Carbidopa<weight>26%<bk>levodopa drug combination carbidopa<weight>86%<bk>Myopia<weight>100%<bk>Levodopa<weight>100%<bk>Chickens<weight>79%<bk>complementarity<weight>100%<bk>microRNA<weight>85%<bk>Animals<weight>6%<bk>Conservation<weight>80%<bk>branching<weight>77%<bk>Lenses<weight>84%<bk>Pharmacology<weight>59%<bk>ADTN<weight>87%<bk>Dopamine<weight>45%<bk>Spiperone<weight>41%<bk>SCH 23390<weight>17%<bk>Bhutan<weight>33%<bk>Referral and Consultation<weight>14%<bk>Logistic Models<weight>13%<bk>Southeastern Asia<weight>12%<bk>Ophthalmic Solutions<weight>37%<bk>Intravitreal Injections<weight>30%<bk>Deuterium<weight>17%<bk>Eye<weight>50%<bk>Safety<weight>52%<bk>Theoretical Models<weight>72%<bk>Growth<weight>42%<bk>Animal Models<weight>27%<bk>Epidemics<weight>77%<bk>Causality<weight>16%<bk>Young Adult<weight>14%<bk>Degenerative Myopia<weight>14%<bk>Dopamine D1 Receptors<weight>100%<bk>Light<weight>63%<bk>ecopipam<weight>21%<bk>Retina<weight>71%<bk>caste<weight>100%<bk>honeybee<weight>99%<bk>Bees<weight>100%<bk>bee<weight>83%<bk>methylation<weight>80%<bk>Swainsonine<weight>100%<bk>Mannosidases<weight>99%<bk>swainsonine<weight>91%<bk>mannosidases<weight>86%<bk>Vision Disorders<weight>99%<bk>Antioxidants<weight>67%<bk>Neurotransmitter Agents<weight>38%<bk>Tupaiidae<weight>20%<bk>Honey<weight>99%<bk>Social Class<weight>70%<bk>MicroRNAs<weight>64%<bk>Genome<weight>20%<bk>F 4<weight>15%<bk>Direction compound<weight>100%<bk>Messenger RNA<weight>78%<bk>Animal Model<weight>100%<bk>Nonhuman Primate<weight>11%<bk>Plasticity<weight>10%<bk>Pathway<weight>8%<bk>Research Personnel<weight>63%<bk>Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists<weight>26%<bk>Refractive Errors<weight>100%<bk>Proteomics<weight>79%<bk>Glucagon<weight>100%<bk>RNA<weight>71%<bk>Crystallins<weight>100%<bk>Amacrine Cells<weight>100%<bk>Crystalline Lens<weight>47%<bk>Gene Expression<weight>45%<bk>Genes<weight>30%<bk>Dopamine Antagonists<weight>36%<bk>Sunlight<weight>27%<bk>Withholding Treatment<weight>13%<bk>Muscarinic Antagonists<weight>100%<bk>Dopamine Agonists<weight>92%,Associate Professor,Canberra,Myopia<weight>100%<bk>Eye<weight>32%<bk>Lenses<weight>32%<bk>Chickens<weight>24%<bk>Growth<weight>22%<bk>Light<weight>21%<bk>Levodopa<weight>19%<bk>Dopamine<weight>19%<bk>Bees<weight>17%<bk>Retina<weight>13%<bk>Honey<weight>13%<bk>RNA<weight>10%<bk>ADTN<weight>8%<bk>Social Class<weight>8%<bk>Carbidopa<weight>7%<bk>MicroRNAs<weight>7%<bk>Swainsonine<weight>7%<bk>Mannosidases<weight>7%<bk>Atropine<weight>7%<bk>Animals<weight>7%<bk>Amacrine Cells<weight>6%<bk>Refractive Errors<weight>6%<bk>Muscarinic Antagonists<weight>6%<bk>Dopamine Agonists<weight>6%<bk>Spiperone<weight>6%<bk>Animal Models<weight>5%<bk>Crystallins<weight>5%<bk>levodopa drug combination carbidopa<weight>5%<bk>Dopamine D1 Receptors<weight>5%<bk>Apis mellifera<weight>9%<bk>honey bees<weight>8%<bk>swainsonine<weight>6%<bk>mannosidases<weight>6%,,UC_61585aa8d7b0c43ebd7551e2

Selen Ayirtman Ercan,"Dr Selen Ercan is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Centre for Deliberative Democracy and Global Governance, University of Canberra. Her work sits at the intersection of normativedemocratictheory andempirical political research, and examines a wide range of topics including the politics of inclusion and exclusion in multicultural societies, the prospects for public deliberation in the face of value conflicts and polarised public debates, and the potential of new forms of political participation and protest movements in reviving democratic practice.Selen s recent book, Mending Democracy. Democratic Repair in Disconnected Times(2020, Oxford University Press, with Hendriks and Boswell)examines how everyday citizens, community groups, politicians and public administrators respond to the crisis of representative democracy, and offer novel ways of reimagining and reforming it.Selen has published over 30 articles and book chapters on deliberative democracy, social movements, multiculturalism, and research methods in Social Sciences. Her publications have appeared in various journals including: International Political Science Review, Policy and Politics, Australian Journal of Political Science, Environmental Politics, Social Movement Studies, and Critical Policy Studies. Two of her articles won the best paper prize of the journal, Policy and Politics in 2017 and 2019. Selen holds a BA in Political Science and Public Administration (METU, Turkey), a MA in Political Science and Sociology (University of Heidelberg, Germany), and a PhD in Political Science (Australian National University).

The project develops new knowledge through an innovative synthesis of culturalsociology and deliberative democracy to analyse nine cases of responses in the public realm to attacks.Monitoring Deliberative Integrity in AustraliaChief Investigator, Special Research Initiative Grant (2021-2024), funded by the Australian Research Council ($202,106).This project aims to develop and apply the concept of deliberative integrity as a counterpart to more familiar ideasabout electoral integrity in the evaluation of democratic processes. The project develops significant newknowledge about the ethical conduct of Australian citizen engagement processes through conceptual andmethodological innovation to produce a Deliberative Integrity Monitoring Tool that will be applied to the expandingrange of deliberative democratic innovations in Australia.Connecting to ParliamentChief Investigator, funded by University of Canberra and Ohio State University (2020-present).This project seeks to link a representative sample of constituents with their elected official in productive town hall conversations about the issues that are subject to parliamentary debate in Australia. The project seeks to involve more Australians in the democratic process, and to expand knowledge about the potential benefits and uses of deliberative democracy.

It focuses particularly on the changing dynamics of communication in contemporary public spheres (partly as a result of the rise of Information and Communication Technologies) and explore the implications of these changes for democracies.ParticipediaCo-investigator (2017-present), funded by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada).The Australian contingent of this project seeks to develop systematic and practical information on the variety of democratic innovations from all over Australia.The project aims to 1) comprehensively catalogue current and past participatory Australian political processes and 2) explore emergent themes and lessons from Australian cases 3) develop a future research agenda for learning across cases to provide systematic and practical advice for researchers and practitioners worldwide. These objectives feed into Participedia s primary aims of mapping democratic innovations, explaining and assessing their contribution to democracy and most importantly, transferring this knowledge back into practice.

61585bfbd7b0c43ebd7551f2,Science,mailto:Nicole.Beard@canberra.edu.au,Nicole Beard,"Dr Beard and her research team investigate how intracellular calcium signaling pathways initiate muscle contraction. We explore and define the mechanisms which lead to control of calcium signalling and the way in which these are disrupted in skeletal myopathies, cardiomyopathy and heart failure.Muscle contraction occurs due to a cascade of events and relies on calcium release from intracellular stores. The four main cogs in the intracellular calcium signalling pathway are the calcium binding protein calsequestrin (CSQ), the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channel, and two linking proteins - triadin and junctin - which bind CSQ to the RyR. Control of calcium release in muscle is vital; disturbances in the process can lead to potentially fatal skeletal and cardiac conditions.Despite their essential role in skeletal muscle and the heart, the functional and structural interactions between the proteins that drive calcium signalling are poorly understood and form the broad aims of our research.Currently funded projects include:Calcium signalling by intracellular calcium stores: implications for muscle performance and athletic abilityCalcium homeostatis disturbances and human heart failureUnderstanding how chemotherapy agents cause cardiotoxicityResearch interestsHeart failureCardiomyopathySkeletal muscle ageing and myopathy",Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins<weight>100%<bk>Hot Temperature<weight>90%<bk>Exercise<weight>76%<bk>lipopolysaccharide-binding protein<weight>77%<bk>Lipopolysaccharides<weight>36%<bk>omecamtiv mecarbil<weight>100%<bk>Norepinephrine<weight>42%<bk>Heart<weight>52%<bk>Systolic Heart Failure<weight>7%<bk>Atrial Appendage<weight>7%<bk>Permeability<weight>100%<bk>Humidity<weight>52%<bk>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum<weight>90%<bk>Heart Failure<weight>59%<bk>Calcium<weight>55%<bk>Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel<weight>100%<bk>Diastole<weight>96%<bk>Oxidation-Reduction<weight>77%<bk>Phosphorylation<weight>44%<bk>Phenotype<weight>48%<bk>Calmodulin<weight>88%<bk>tacrolimus binding protein 1B<weight>14%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Type III<weight>100%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Types I and II<weight>84%<bk>Hereditary Angioedemas<weight>69%<bk>Safety<weight>28%<bk>Ion Channel Gating<weight>100%<bk>Ventricular Fibrillation<weight>26%<bk>Polymorphic catecholergic ventricular tachycardia<weight>36%<bk>Atrial Fibrillation<weight>22%<bk>Muscle Weakness<weight>100%<bk>Actins<weight>79%<bk>Rheumatoid Arthritis<weight>77%<bk>Skeletal Muscle<weight>51%<bk>Arthritis<weight>27%<bk>Calcium Signaling<weight>95%<bk>Ion Channels<weight>79%<bk>Thymus<weight>38%<bk>Post Translational Protein Processing<weight>83%<bk>Muscle<weight>75%<bk>Myocardium<weight>53%<bk>Tacrolimus Binding Proteins<weight>19%<bk>Protein Binding<weight>67%<bk>Channelopathies<weight>9%<bk>Tacrolimus<weight>17%<bk>Excitation Contraction Coupling<weight>73%<bk>Proteins<weight>17%<bk>Pharmacology<weight>54%<bk>Muscular Diseases<weight>87%<bk>Sulfhydryl Compounds<weight>12%<bk>Homeostasis<weight>8%<bk>adriamycinol<weight>81%<bk>Calsequestrin<weight>100%<bk>Anthracyclines<weight>90%<bk>triadin<weight>100%<bk>Chemical activation<weight>50%<bk>Muscles<weight>8%<bk>Mixed Function Oxygenases<weight>8%<bk>Aspartic Acid<weight>7%<bk>L-Type Calcium Channels<weight>100%<bk>Skeletal Muscle Fibers<weight>7%<bk>Protein Isoforms<weight>19%<bk>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases<weight>100%<bk>Doxorubicin<weight>60%<bk>Cardiac Arrhythmias<weight>17%<bk>Cytoplasm<weight>65%<bk>Sheep<weight>57%<bk>Inhibition (Psychology)<weight>8%<bk>Adrenergic Agents<weight>87%<bk>calcium<weight>61%<bk>phosphorylation<weight>23%<bk>Scorpions<weight>100%<bk>Cystine<weight>90%<bk>Disulfides<weight>74%<bk>Cystine Knot Motifs<weight>34%<bk>skeletal muscle<weight>51%<bk>Cardiac Output<weight>76%<bk>Health<weight>40%<bk>Action Potentials<weight>27%<bk>Daunorubicin<weight>100%<bk>Dithiothreitol<weight>8%<bk>Knockout Mice<weight>59%<bk>Carrier Proteins<weight>54%<bk>Pharmaceutical Preparations<weight>33%<bk>Heart Diseases<weight>19%<bk>K201 compound<weight>15%<bk>Ryanodine<weight>21%<bk>Peptides<weight>20%<bk>Rabbits<weight>11%<bk>Muscle Contraction<weight>57%<bk>Muscle Proteins<weight>76%<bk>Graves Disease<weight>73%<bk>Mutation<weight>22%,Associate Professor,Canberra,Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel<weight>26%<bk>Calsequestrin<weight>43%<bk>Sarcoplasmic Reticulum<weight>24%<bk>triadin<weight>8%<bk>Skeletal Muscle<weight>23%<bk>Calcium<weight>10%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Type III<weight>9%<bk>Excitation Contraction Coupling<weight>8%<bk>Muscular Diseases<weight>8%<bk>Hereditary Angioedema Types I and II<weight>8%<bk>Myocardium<weight>8%<bk>Phosphorylation<weight>7%<bk>adriamycinol<weight>7%<bk>Anthracyclines<weight>7%<bk>Ion Channels<weight>5%<bk>Proteins<weight>6%<bk>Hereditary Angioedemas<weight>6%<bk>Oxidation-Reduction<weight>6%<bk>Heart<weight>6%<bk>Muscles<weight>5%<bk>Heart Failure<weight>5%<bk>Hot Temperature<weight>5%<bk>Graves Disease<weight>5%<bk>lipopolysaccharide-binding protein<weight>5%<bk>Muscle<weight>10%,,UC_61585bfbd7b0c43ebd7551f2

61585d29d7b0c43ebd755204,Psychology,null,Petra Buergelt,"OVERVIEWI am a transdisciplinary social scientist who lectures and researches at the University of Canberra. I am a Sylff Fellow (Ryoichi Sasakwa Young Leaders Fellowship, Tokyo & Nippon Foundation), a research fellow at the Joint Centre for Disaster Research (Massey University, NZ), and an international associate at the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research (Victoria University, NZ).I am the co-founder and former Deputy Chair of the Group of Energy Efficient Researchers (GEER) Australia.My research interest is human adaptation and transformation. I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8). I am serving as an editorial board member of the International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches (since 2006), Disaster Communication (since 2016) and Journal of Psychology (since 2010). Since 2007, I am reviewing academic papers for various international disaster, migration, and research design journals. I have been awarded numerous national and international scholarships and fellowships.RESEARCH PROJECTSYearResearch Project, Role & Team 2003Individual and social factors constraining preparation for tsunami hazardsResearch Assistant, Washington State Government, USA Research team members: Professor Douglas Paton (UTAS, Australia), Dr David Johnson (GNS, NZ), Dr Kevin Ronan (Massey University, NZ), George Crawford (US National Tsunami Programme)2004 - 05Risk management for natural hazards - bushfiresResearch Assistant, University of Tasmania and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), AustraliaResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), Dr Gail Kelly (CSIRO)2007 - 09Psychosocial factors influencing individual and community preparedness for avian flu pandemicPrincipal Researcher, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, New ZealandResearch team members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia) and A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research)2011 - 12Community level influence on individual behaviours with respect to bushfire readiness and decision making Post-doctorial Research Associate, University of Western Australia, Australia and Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (Bushfire CRC)Research team members: W/Professor David Morrison, W/Professor Carmen Lawrence, Professor Timothy Skinner, Professor Colin McCleod, Dr Lies Notebart, Dr Illy McNeil, and Patrick Dunlop2012 - 14Housing and neighbourhoods that generate social inclusion, economic opportunities and wellbeingResearcher, University of Western Australia, Business School, Centre for Social ImpactResearch Team: Professor Paul Flatau (UWA), A/Professor Paul Maginn (UWA) and A/Professor Val Colic-Peisker (RMIT)2014 - 16Community understanding of the tsunami risk and warnings systems in Australian communitiesResearcher, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC Research group members: Professor Douglas Paton (University of Tasmania, Australia), A/Professor David Johnston (Massey University, Centre for Disaster Research), Katelyn Rossiter (University of Tasmania, Australia)2014 - 16 Dharray manymakkuŋ pawaw ga gapuw*  – Manymak Energy Efficiency Project with Indigenous Communities in East Arnhem LandPrincipal Researcher & Evaluator, Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods,Research Team: A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Professor Tim Skinner, Julia Becker, A/Professor Simon Moss, A/Prof Anne Lowell, Mirza Baig (CDU)Project Team: Federal Department of Industries, Power and Water Cooperation, Northern Territory Government Department of Housing, Centre for Appropriate Technology, East Arnhem Regional Council2016 -Northern Australian Bushfire and Natural Hazard TrainingResearcher & Evaluator, Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC & CDU Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods Research team members: Steve Sudden (CDU, RIEL), Dr Bev Sithole (ARPNet), various Indigenous Researchers from ARPNet, Iolante Sudden2017-2018Arts Related Disaster Risk Reduction: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Artist s Cultural Knowledge & Skills Exchange and CreationsPrincipal Investigator – project leaderResearch team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni Lee, A/Prof Ioannis Michaloudis, Dr Benxiang Zeng, Dr Michelle Moss, Dr Jelena Zeleskov Doric (all CDU but different disciplines)2018-2019Using Arts to heal, reduce the risk of disasters and adapt to climate change: Australian-Taiwanese Indigenous Cultural Knowledge and Skills Exchange and Creation Principal Investigator – project leaderInternational research team members: Prof Douglas Paton, , A/Prof Elaine Lawurrpa Maypilama, Toni D.

My research methodologies have included mixed and unique qualitative, with basic quantitative, methods.  My current research includes working with agricultural communities in developing countries, including PNG and Pakistan.I am currently working on two ACIAR funded research projects. 1) In PNG with women and their families developing, implementing and evaluating a Women s Team Leadership training programmes. 2) A water sustainability research project based in Pakistan that aims to increase productivity and profitability, to reduce poverty, of small and middle-sized irrigated farms through improved water and nutrient management on irrigated farms.   I am a founding member of UC CIRI (The University of Canberra Collaborative Indigenous Research Initiative). UC CIRI is a new network of researchers committed to Indigenous Studies research. UC CIRI supports collaboration among UC s Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff and fosters local, national and international partnerships. For more information see http://www.canberra.edu.au/research/collaborations/ciri/about   I have developed culturally appropriate and relevant curricula and teaching materials for diverse groups nationally and internationally. These skills will be drawn on to create a new teaching methodology for the above PNG and Pakistan projects.  I have over twenty years experience working with remote Indigenous adults, particularly women, across Australia, teaching linguistics skills to Indigenous Australians so they could document and maintain their own traditional languages.

Understanding environmental and social influences is essential to inform targeted interventions to reduce population health disparities. Her research involves use of Geographic Information Systems to characterise environments and complex statistical approaches including multilevel modelling and structural equation models to assess relationships. Suzanne also has experience in survey design, health- and fitness-related data collection including anthropometry and indirect calorimetry, and qualitative research methods.ResearchInterestsEnvironmental and social determinants of health, health behaviour, and wellbeing; health across the lifecourse",Early Detection of Cancer<weight>100%<bk>Breast Neoplasms<weight>67%<bk>Motor Vehicles<weight>28%<bk>Hospital Shops<weight>13%<bk>General Practitioners<weight>12%<bk>Body Size<weight>99%<bk>Observational Studies<weight>68%<bk>Cross-Sectional Studies<weight>57%<bk>Waist Circumference<weight>70%<bk>Body Mass Index<weight>53%<bk>Small-Area Analysis<weight>28%<bk>capital city<weight>100%<bk>cross-sectional study<weight>87%<bk>waist circumference<weight>100%<bk>residential areas<weight>86%<bk>body mass index<weight>77%<bk>Economic Status<weight>72%<bk>trajectories<weight>66%<bk>mental health<weight>100%<bk>glycohemoglobin<weight>94%<bk>Nutrition<weight>86%<bk>path analysis<weight>83%<bk>physical activity<weight>80%<bk>Built Environment<weight>100%<bk>Middle Aged<weight>100%<bk>Education<weight>29%<bk>Smoking<weight>100%<bk>Health<weight>6%<bk>Hot Temperature<weight>15%<bk>Northern Territory<weight>14%<bk>Community Health Centers<weight>12%<bk>incident<weight>50%<bk>location factors<weight>49%<bk>socioeconomic status<weight>45%<bk>accounting<weight>41%<bk>education<weight>30%<bk>Glycated Hemoglobin A<weight>73%<bk>Fruit<weight>90%<bk>Overweight<weight>84%<bk>Obesity<weight>85%<bk>Marital Status<weight>37%<bk>Health Behavior<weight>36%<bk>Buffers<weight>31%<bk>Body Weight<weight>67%<bk>Food<weight>26%<bk>Population<weight>37%<bk>Fast Foods<weight>100%<bk>ideal body weight<weight>100%<bk>walking<weight>66%<bk>lipids<weight>34%<bk>burden of disease<weight>23%<bk>smoking (food products)<weight>21%<bk>Hemoglobin<weight>84%<bk>Cohort<weight>76%<bk>Health Promotion<weight>97%<bk>Walking<weight>86%<bk>Exercise<weight>60%<bk>Rural Population<weight>100%<bk>Weights and Measures<weight>47%<bk>Sitting Position<weight>6%<bk>high density lipoprotein-1<weight>100%<bk>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus<weight>90%<bk>Cardiovascular Diseases<weight>87%<bk>Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis<weight>76%<bk>Arterioles<weight>65%,Senior Research Fellow,Canberra,Built Environment<weight>100%<bk>Glycated Hemoglobin A<weight>97%<bk>Body Mass Index<weight>97%<bk>Waist Circumference<weight>78%<bk>Overweight<weight>59%<bk>Body Size<weight>56%<bk>Observational Studies<weight>53%<bk>Obesity<weight>46%<bk>Middle Aged<weight>45%<bk>Food<weight>44%<bk>Fast Foods<weight>43%<bk>Health<weight>43%<bk>Early Detection of Cancer<weight>42%<bk>Exercise<weight>40%<bk>Education<weight>35%<bk>Fruit<weight>34%<bk>Smoking<weight>33%<bk>Health Promotion<weight>33%<bk>Diet<weight>30%<bk>Cross-Sectional Studies<weight>29%<bk>Population<weight>29%<bk>Rural Population<weight>29%<bk>Buffers<weight>28%<bk>Breast Neoplasms<weight>28%<bk>Food Industry<weight>28%<bk>Marital Status<weight>25%<bk>Economic Status<weight>25%<bk>Social Class<weight>22%<bk>Mental Health<weight>20%<bk>Health Status<weight>20%<bk>Health Behavior<weight>20%<bk>Walking<weight>19%<bk>Public Health<weight>19%<bk>Cluster Analysis<weight>18%<bk>Body Weight<weight>17%<bk>Weights and Measures<weight>16%<bk>South Australia<weight>5%<bk>Depression<weight>14%<bk>Income<weight>14%<bk>Industry<weight>14%<bk>Motor Vehicles<weight>12%<bk>Growth<weight>12%<bk>Vegetables<weight>10%<bk>Environmental Exposure<weight>10%<bk>Population Density<weight>7%<bk>Adiposity<weight>7%<bk>Chronic Disease<weight>7%<bk>Health Surveys<weight>7%<bk>Longitudinal Studies<weight>6%<bk>mental health<weight>39%<bk>waist circumference<weight>35%<bk>ideal body weight<weight>35%<bk>glycohemoglobin<weight>31%<bk>residential areas<weight>30%<bk>path analysis<weight>27%<bk>body mass index<weight>27%<bk>physical activity<weight>26%<bk>trajectories<weight>23%<bk>walking<weight>23%<bk>diet<weight>14%<bk>lipids<weight>12%<bk>adiposity<weight>11%<bk>smoking (food products)<weight>10%<bk>burden of disease<weight>8%<bk>noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus<weight>7%<bk>heart diseases<weight>7%<bk>stroke<weight>6%<bk>fruit consumption<weight>6%<bk>obesity<weight>5%<bk>colon<weight>5%<bk>breasts<weight>5%,,UC_61585daad7b0c43ebd75520d
61585dc2d7b0c43ebd75520e,Canberra Business School,null,David Carter,"I am the Research Lead in the Canberra Business School in the Faculty of Business, Government and Law.My research examines the politics of information concerning accounting, law, politics, regulation, and discourses of capital. My work is trans-disciplinary and concerns how information (including metrics, economics, accounting and statistics) is used within legal and political processes, which explores the interface of law and regulation within government, public policy, corporate, regulatory and litigation settings. Traditionally, information is presented in legal and political environments as apolitical, objective and capable of resolving problems and conflicts. My research investigates the politics of  information , depicting the role of information at methodological, technical, and political levels.I draw on a range of post-structural theory in my work, including Laclau and Mouffe, Hardt and Negri, Lazzarato, Gramsci, Luxemburg, Marx, and have a deep interest in jurisprudential theory, research philosophy and post-colonial literatures. Thus, my research focuses on three main pillars: the politics of information (in an ontological sense); the nature of governance and regulation; and the discourse of capital.",Epistemic

61585ec8d7b0c43ebd755222,Creative & Cultural Practice,mailto:Dudley.Creagh@canberra.edu.au,Dudley Creagh,"SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF MY RESEARCH INVOLVEMENT 1957 -2018AttachmentsNational/International Involvement -- Summary of Executed Designs –Honours and Awards  My research career started in1957 with the commencement of the fourth (Honours) year of my Physics course at Queensland University. My field study was Ionospheric Physics. I was awarded 1st Class Honours for a thesis entitled: The design of a correlation computer for the resolution of radio fading data. The computer was devised in an era before transistors and digital technology existed. I trained at the University of Queensland Faculty of Education as a Science Teacher in 1957 and in 1958 was posted to teach at the Toowoomba State High School and Technical College. Whilst in Toowoomba I surveyed the Toowoomba area for an appropriate site for an Atmospheric Whistler experimental station for Professor Hugh Webster (Physics: University of Queensland).University of New England In 1959 I was invited by Professor Jack Somerville to take up a position as Lecturer in Physics at the University of New England. My research field changed from Ionospheric Physics to Plasma Physics. In this new field of research I studied the evolution of the conducting channel which is created when a spark occurs between electrodes. I developed a new experimental methodology and created the equipment to implement the research. This research resulted in the award of an MSc for a thesis entitled: The decay of spark channels which have ceased to carry current. These were the first observations of the complete temporal evolution of electric sparks and defined the time at which the conducting channel of the spark could be a conduit for a further spark.Royal Military College, Duntroon My next appointment (1962) was at the Royal Military College of Australia (RMC) as a Lecturer in Physics where I continued my research in Plasma Physics. When the Snowy Mountains Laboratory disposed of their 6m Hilger High Resolution Optical Spectrometer, I acquired it and had it installed at RMC. I adapted it to enable studies of the cross-sectional temperature distribution in low current electric arcs to be performed. And I devised a novel transistor-controlled power supply to stabilize the emission from these arcs so that precise spectral measurements could be made.University College, University of New South Wales From 1962 to 1968 courses at RMC evolved, as RMC as an institution made the transition to being a College of the University of New South Wales. The field of Solid State Physics was seen as an essential element of the new BSc Degree structure and to teach it, new equipment was acquired and brought into operation. The new equipment included transmission and scanning electron microscopes, an X-ray diffractometer, and an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. In 1965 I received a Commonwealth Post Graduate Scholarship to undertake the MSc course in the Physics of Materials at the University of Bristol. The research element of this degree involved the development of an X-ray interferometer, and its use for the measurement of X-ray refractive indices. I was awarded an MSc for a thesis entitled: The measurement of X-ray refractive indices using an X-ray interferometer. This led to further research in the field of X-ray scattering. The X-ray interferometer studies on alkali halides enabled precise determinations of the X-ray anomalous dispersion corrections to be made. These parameters need to be known accurately because they are used extensively in the quantitative analysis of X-ray diffraction data. My experiments showed that a discrepancy existed between the current theoretical predictions and the experimental results. The theories at that time were based on non-relativistic models of photon scattering. I developed a relativistic quantum mechanical multipole model of photon scattering which gave predictions in close agreement with the experimental data. On my return to RMC I continued research into measuring the temperature distribution in electric arcs. And I continued my work on X-ray scattering, devising equipment which could measure X-ray absorption with greater precision than had hitherto been achieved. The scattering and absorption processes are physically linked, so the results of an interferometry experiment could be used to predict the anomalous dispersion corrections and vice versa. Professor GVH Wilson became Professor of Physics at RMC in 1971. His field of research was Condensed Matter Physics, in particular, studies of magnetic materials such as the cobalt, samarium, holmium, and the cubic Laves phase intermetallics, GdFe2, GdCo2 and GdAl2. in the years 1970 to 1982 I was involved in the study of the structure and properties of these materials using X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ferromagnetic resonance, and the Mossbauer effect. I enrolled for a PhD degree in the field of X-ray Scattering in 1972 and in 1975 was awarded that degree for a thesis entitled Measurement of X-ray dispersion corrections and mass absorption coefficients for various halides. I took Sabbatical Leave in 1977 at the (then) US National Bureau of Standards (NBS) working there with John Hubbell. The NBS awarded me their Citation for Excellence for research completed there. In 1978 I received an invitation from the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) to set up an international round-robin experiment for the measurement of X-ray attenuation coefficients. World-wide, eleven international laboratories participated in the experiment. They were provided with sets of well- characterized specimens. I characterized the materials using a wide range of physical techniques and I later performed experiments on these specimens, replicating the experimental arrangements used by the participating laboratories. The results of this study led to improvements in the quality of data collected experimentally, and the accuracy of the theoretical computations of X-ray attenuation coefficients. In 1979 I was awarded a French Government Scientific and Technical Fellowship. I worked with Professor Erwin Bertaut at the Institute Laue Langevin, Grenoble, on group theoretical studies of magnetic spin ordering in solids; and with Professor Andre Authier (University of Paris V: Pierre and Marie Curie) on the possibility of observing nuclear anomalous scattering in cadmium sulphide using neutron scattering.Australian Defence Force Academy In the early 1980s, developments relating to the education of officers of the Australian Defence Force saw the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), an amalgamation of the existing service colleges (Army: RMC; Air Force: Point Cook; Navy: Jervis Bay). With this came new courses and the need to design experimental suites for the new Physics Building. These suites were to house new electron microscopes (which needed electromagnetically shielded rooms and antivibration flooring), together with the specimen preparation areas. As well, facilities for X-ray Diffraction, Laue Diffraction, and X-ray topography were designed and the equipment was brought into service. I was responsible for the planning management and maintenance of these facilities. In 1988 I was invited by the IUCr to contribute chapters on X-ray scattering to their handbook, International Tables for Crystallography Volume C (ITC), which serves as a source of reference data for more than 100,000 researchers worldwide. I wrote five chapters for this volume: on X-ray spectra, X-ray attenuation, X-ray dispersion corrections, monochromators, and precautions against radiation injury. The chapters on X-ray dispersion and X-ray attenuation contained data calculated using my relativistic multipole X-ray scattering theory. These were compared with the most recent experimental results. In 1989 I was invited by the Academia Sinica to give lecture courses on modern X-ray scattering theory and practice. The President of the Academia Sinica presented me with the Chinese Chemical Society medal in recognition of my service to the Chinese Academy of Science. During the 1980s research activities were diverse. I remained involved in the study of ferro-magnetic materials, both elemental and rare-earth intermetallic, using a variety of pulsed nuclear magnetic techniques. Other scientific technologies were changing rapidly. In 1984, in my capacity as Chairman of the Commission on Crystallographic Apparatus of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), I was invited by the Director and the Japanese scientists to construct an Australian beamline at the Japanese synchrotron, the Photon Factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). This was identified as the Australian National Beamline Facility (ANBF). Obtaining funding for this enterprise was a momentous task. As Chairman of the Australian Synchrotron Radiation Users Group I made numerous submissions to the relevant Commonwealth Government Agencies, the Australian Academy of Science, the Academy of Science Technology and Engineering Council, and the Australian Research Council. Eventually in 1992 the president of the Australian Research Council (ARC), Professor Don Aitken, managed to convene a consortium including the ARC, the CSIRO, Ansto, the University College UNSW (ADFA) and the Australian National University to undertake the project. The Australian Academy of Science (AAS) was also a member of the consortium but contributed no financial assistance. In the period 1992-1997 I designed the X-ray beamline and planned for all the associated facilities which supported its operation (the experimental hutch, the container house and its furnishings, vehicle).I supervised the construction of the complete system: beamline, monochromator, diffractometer and the integrated electronic control and data analysis systems. The beamline and X-ray monochromator were constructed in the Physics Department at ADFA in Canberra; the furniture for the container house in nearby Queanbeyan NSW; negotiations with Toyota Australia resulted in the provision of a vehicle in Japan. The unique vacuum diffractometer (designed by Stephen Wilkins (CSIRO) and myself) was constructed by the Materials Division CSIRO. Accessories for the diffractometer were designed and developed by my team at ADFA. This was the first dedicated Australian synchrotron facility and educated a new generation of Australian scientists. In 1993 I was awarded a (Japanese Government) Monbusho Technical Fellowship which funded four months residence in Japan thus enabling me to supervise the installation of the beamline and all its components. The Australian National Beamline Facility (ANBF: BL20B, Photon Factory, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan), became operational in late1993. Because the initial funding was for just three years, further funding had to be sought to maintain its operation after 1997. Australian Government support was forthcoming in 1998 under the Major National Research Facilities Program. This ensured the ANBF was able to remain in operation to 2002. When the Australian Synchrotron was funded in 2002 the ANBF became part of the Australian Synchrotron s research program. When the ANBF was decommissioned in 2015 it had been used by many hundreds of Australian scientists. Whilst on sabbatical leave at the ANU Research School of Chemistry (RSC) in 1996 I designed a unique liquid-air interface Small Angle Scattering System. This enabled the RSC to commence a wide range of research projects on the processes taking place at the liquid-air interface using X-ray Reflectivity. Design and construction of this system led me to the design of other equipment which would later be used at synchrotron radiation sources for the study of self-organizing protective wax coatings on metal surfaces; the tensile testing of elastomers and carbon fibres; fracture toughness of acronitrile copolymers; studies of epitaxial layers grown on semiconductor surfaces (such as GaAs multi-well quantum effect and quantum dot semiconductor devices). My involvement in the scientific conservation of cultural materials commenced in 1988 through a collaboration with the Australian War Memorial (AWM) where their conservation staff were restoring a Japanese Zero fighter for display. They needed to be certain that the composition of the aluminium they proposed using would be compatible with the Zero s airframe. This was to be the first of many collaborations with a diverse range of national and international collecting institutions. Significant amongst these were studies of all the Victoria Crosses in the custody of the AWM and the Waiouru Museum in New Zealand, and a study of the (German) Lusitania Medal. I retired from ADFA in 1996, leaving to take the position of Professor of the Physics of Materials at the University of Canberra.University of Canberra Here, research has proceeded on a number of different fronts, and involves collaborations with other faculties of the university, other Australian universities, major national and international facilities, and with Australian Government departments and instrumentalities. Overseas collaborations have included, inter alia, the US National institute of Science and Technology (NIST), the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands, the Royal Armouries in the UK, and the US Naval Research Laboratory. More recently my research has been conducted in the following fields: X-ray Scattering, the design of advanced scientific equipment, Cultural Heritage studies, Forensic Science, Border Protection, and Schools of Arts Buildings in Australia.X-ray Scattering I am a leading international expert on X-ray Scattering. I have submitted (2017) complete revisions of tables, on the fundamental scattering parameters for atoms, for inclusion in International Tables for Crystallography Volume C (with Professor Chris Chantler). This includes a total of six chapters on the Production of X-rays, X-ray Spectra, X-ray Absorption, Monochromators, and the X-ray Dispersion Corrections. The latter chapter includes the most recent calculations of the scattering parameters by Chantler and Creagh and comparisons with recent experimental data. As well, the section on Precautions against Injury has been revised to include the most recent regulatory requirements for work with ionizing radiation. Research with collaborators at the University of Melbourne and Latrobe University into X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) continues and chapters for the new International Tables for Crystallography Volume I are ready for submission to the editor. At the ceremony marking the closure of the ANBF at the Photon Factory in 2013 the International X-ray Absorption Society conferred on me a Lifetime Achievement Award. The International Radiation Physics Society (IRPS) conferred on me their Lifetime Achievement Award at their 2015 Congress in Beijing.Cultural Heritage  For 30 years I have maintained close collaborations with the National collecting institutions (the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia, The National Film and Sound Archive, the National Museum of Australia). These collaborations have led to research funded by the Australian Research Council including: the protection of base metals from corrosion; the protection of outdoor statuary; the degradation of bark paintings (which has led to improved techniques for mounting, display and conservation of bark paintings); the study of the degradation of inks on paper, pigments on surfaces, and photographic film. Studies have been made on Joe Byrne s armour, shrapnel and artefacts from HMAS Sydney, and paints used by the  Angry Penguins  school of Australian paintings. More recently, in a collaboration with the Rijksmuseum (The Netherlands), the Queen Victoria Museum and Gallery (Tasmania), and the West Australian Gallery, I have been involved in X-ray synchrotron radiation studies of the Dirk Hartog plate (which is a Dutch national treasure) and 19th century easel paintings. As well, synchrotron radiation has been used to collect data in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum to assist in the authentication of important easel paintings.Design of Advanced Scientific Equipment From 2002 to 2008 I designed the Infrared Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, regarded currently by international researchers as the most stable and versatile Infrared beamline in the world. I remained involved in the maintenance of the ANBF at the KEK, Tsukuba, Japan, and improved its capabilities, especially in the field of X-ray Absorption Fine Structures (XAFS) through ARC funded grants. I had designed the X-ray beamline at this facility in 1992. With Ansto scientists I designed and developed a methodology, including the testing devices, for evaluating the performance of each of the types of X-ray systems used for air cargo and shipping container examination (2008 -2012). These devices have been patented and are in production. In 2013 I devised an X-ray system which enabled the examination of marine artefacts which were raised from, and re-interred in a shipwreck, as part of the Australian Historical Shipwreck Preservation Project. The X-ray system allowed the simultaneous recording of 3D-optical and X-ray images. Research is continuing in X-ray phase contrast imaging and the development of systems to evaluate computed tomography (CT) systems. I remain involved in the development of standards for the testing of systems used by Border Protection Agencies. Currently I serve on International Committees to assess the performance of: X-ray systems used at passenger portals at airports (NIST/AINSI: F792); CT systems used at passenger portals; as well as bottle and can examination systems (Comité International Electrotechnique).Forensic Science Research in this field covers a wide range of materials and the use of a diverse range of experimental techniques, much of which is confidential. Studies of street drugs and steroids have been undertaken using Raman spectroscopy. More recently (2015) a study of the estimation of the postmortem degradation interval of skeletal remains has been made using Infrared Spectroscopy.Border Protection From 2000 to 2015 I was Scientific Adviser to the Australian Customs Service (now Border Protection in the Department of Home Affairs), giving advice on a wide range of problems, but mostly on matters involving the use of X-rays. I was responsible, for example, for the acquisition of the high energy-high intensity X-ray systems used in the examination of container systems at the maritime border, the intermediate-energy intermediate-intensity X-ray systems used in air- cargo operations, and the X-ray, infrared/THz/Raman scattering and ion-beam mobility systems used at the passenger portals at airports. I have been the principal author of a number of reports to Australian Government departments (the Department of Infrastructure, the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Forestry and Fisheries). I drafted the regulations which are used for security monitoring of passengers at airline portals.Schools of Arts/Mechanics  Institutes in AustraliaAs part of a wider study of the evolution of the School of Arts Movement I am writing short histories of Schools of Arts in the Canning Downs region of the Darling Downs (Southern Queensland). I have written four so far, with a further three in preparation. The School of Arts Movement commenced in Australia in Hobart in1827, and grew to have about 3000 buildings throughout Australia in 1900. This was an important element of education in Australia, especially in the 19th century, often predating government-funded school systems (which appeared about 1850) and it was a precursor to what we now call adult (or further) education. Importantly, because state-funded libraries did not come into existence until the 1940s Schools of Arts also provided access to lending libraries. The movement was the precursor to technical education, and even museums - in many towns they were called Mechanics  Institutes. This work is important because it enables the study of the social history of the communities, small and large, poor and wealthy, which supported this movement and benefited from what it offered. Much of the information has been lost, or is in danger of being lost.Executed designsExecuted designsThe physical scale of equipment I have designed ranges from the very large to the very small: from beamlines at synchrotron radiation facilities to adapting and improving techniques for the preparation of specimens for use in electron microscopy using microtomes. For example:The design of the Infrared Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, which international researchers say is the most stable and versatile Infrared beamline in the world (2002-2008)I was involved in the development, construction and maintenance of the ANBF at the synchrotron radiation source, the Photon Factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan) through ARC funded grants. I designed the X-ray beamline, its monochromators, and its ancillary components such as an eight-position capillary spinning stage for its unique X-ray diffractometer (1992-2002).For the Research School of Chemistry, ANU, I designed a system for the study of the reflection and diffraction of X-rays from surfaces and interfaces, especially the formation of monolayers on liquid surfaces (1996).I designed a system for evaluating the performance of X-ray systems used for air cargo and shipping container examinations during testing of commercial large tunnel X-ray systems for the Office of Transport Security. The prototype for this system constructed in the workshops at Ansto was used in the OTS trials. It has since been patented, is now in commercial production (2008-2013).Research is proceeding in X-ray phase contrast imaging and the development of systems to evaluate computed tomography (CT) systems as part of a collaboration with NIST and CIEI designed an X-ray system to be used on a jacked-up barge above the wreck of the  Clarence  for the Australian Historical Shipwrecks Preservation Project (AHSPP). This enabled 2-D X-ray images to be reconstituted as 3D- images which would then be compared with 3D- optical photographic images (2013).I designed microprocessor-based laboratory data acquisition system to lower the cost of providing instrumentation in student laboratories (1982).I designed a system for the precise measurement of X-ray attenuation coefficients as part of the IUCr X-ray Attenuation Project (1978).Because equipment was not commercially available for studies of defects in crystals, especially semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide I designed a low cost q axis and linear slide for X-ray topography (1972).A simple low-cost device for the stabilization of dc electric arcs was designed and constructed in 1968.","infrared

61585f79d7b0c43ebd75522c,Health Research Institute,null,Mark Daniel,"Mark Daniel is Professor of Epidemiology in the Health Research Institute, University of Canberra where he leads the Spatial Epidemiology Group. He is concurrently appointed Professorial Fellow in the Department of Medicine, St. Vincent s Hospital, The University of Melbourne, and Senior Principal Research Fellow at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.Mark Daniel holds a Doctorate in Health Care & Epidemiology (University of British Columbia, 1998), Master of Science (University of Manitoba, 1991) and Bachelor of Science (Simon Fraser University, 1989). He first encountered Australia as an MRC Canada Postdoctoral Fellow, based in Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, for two years. He then held faculty appointments in the School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Department of Social & Preventive Medicine, Université de Montréal (as Canada Research Chair: Population Health). He immigrated to Australia in 2008, joining the University of South Australia as Research S.A. Chair: Social Epidemiology and Director: Spatial Epidemiology and Evaluation Research Group. In 2012 he became inaugural Head: School of Population Health. Mark joined the University of Canberra in 2017. He has authored 182 refereed articles and 21 book chapters. He has given 106 invited presentations. His work has been presented at 273 refereed congresses. He has been a chief investigator (CI) on 102 grants exceeding $67.5 M, from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canada Foundation for Innovation, National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia, and Australian Research Council. His grant funding for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was $5.6M, $4.7M, $5.1M, $4.7M and $4.6M, respectively (as CI-A: $576K, $566K, $505K, $451K and $312K for the same years, respectively). He has led 30 grant-funded projects.Mark s emphasis is the intersection of spatial epidemiology and prevention research, particularly the prevention of non-communicable disease and understanding the biological pathways between social and physical environments and important population health outcomes and costs. His work aims to identify the drivers and multi-sectoral levers for policy- and practice-level innovations to reduce risk factors and slow rising rates of chronic disease including obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and cancers related to lifestyle. At the core of his research is the geospatial modelling of area-level factors in inferential analyses of risk factors such as diet, physical activity and smoking, and biochemical/clinical outcomes as these vary over time and change in response to public health and clinical intervention. For 18 years Mark has used GIS – geographic information systems – in spatial analyses of multi-level relationships between social and built environmental factors and chronic disease risk factors and outcomes, emphasising factors that are amenable to local action and policy. He has also used GIS for the evaluation of field experiments, including prevention trials in general and vulnerable populations. Most of this work aims at knowledge translation for improved population health through meaningful partnerships with stakeholders including community leaders, health professionals, and policy makers.Mark has sustained a strong commitment to Aboriginal health throughout his career. He has led community-based research in participatory collaborations with Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Australia, since 1994. Articles reporting this research have contributed to understandings of: (i) the environmental contexts of cardiometabolic diseases in Aboriginal peoples; (ii) direct and indirect pathways underlying these associations, for which the explanatory mechanisms operate not simply via volitional behaviour, but through the non-volitional behaviours and social norms that define lifestyle, and psychosocial and biological responses to chronic stressors; and (iii) conceptual and methodological challenges faced in field research, and solutions for prevention science, in the rigorous evaluation of community-based and population-level intervention programs.Research and Teaching InterestsPopulation health, social epidemiology; spatial epidemiology; chronic, noncommunicable and communicable disease epidemiology; disease prevention; prevention intervention planning, implementation and evaluation; evaluation research including cluster randomised trails and quasi-experimental trials in applied field settings to determine effectiveness for policy and practice.Supervision and MentoringMark has supervised to completion 17 PhD, 14 MSc (thesis) and 4 Honours students. Former students hold faculty positions at prominent institutions including Stanford University, University of California - Los Angeles, University of Miami, Columbia University, and Université Laval. Still others hold senior managerial positions in not-for-profit/ non-government health agencies or government epidemiology roles (Public Health Agency of Canada, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Mark has also directed 13 Postdoctoral Fellows, and been official mentor to 4 Early Career Researchers. Currently, he supervises 5 PhD students.Contribution to Field of ResearchMark built in Montréal a key infrastructure to support effective population health decision making, the Megaphone geographic information system (a copyrighted, registered invention). Megaphone is now applied by public health authorities across Québec. Analyses from Megaphone contributed to a ban on fast food and vending machines in schools. Extensions with Canadian funders focus on interventions within schools to improve healthful eating. Since 2006, Megaphone has been used in 36 projects with grants funding of $24.7M, yielding more than 70 publications. Megaphone is the basis of the new national Australian Epidemiological GIS (AEGIS) that Mark s team is developing in Canberra in an industry partnership with ESRI Australia, the world leader for GIS development. The AEGIS platform is a 2nd generation version of the Megaphone infrastructure that incorporates advances in geospatial database construction, analytic applications, and visual representation. An exciting extension of AEGIS is its role underpinning spatial epidemiological analyses of diabetes in partnership with the Dasman Diabetes Institute, Kuwait, via its integration with a diabetes registry.Collaborations and Community EngagementMark has engaged in 46 industry, government and community initiatives in Australasia, Canada and the USA, India (International Clinical Epidemiology Network), France (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale) and Kuwait (Ministry of Health and Dasman Diabetes Institute) (14 of which remain current in 2018). He has led community-based fieldwork with primary data collection in Canada, the USA, India and Australia. He has collaborated on four administrative data linkage initiatives, in Québec, South Australia, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.Professional InvolvementMark serves/ has served on several notable external committees including: SA/NT Data Link, SA Obesity Prevention & Lifestyle Scientific Advisory, Freemason Foundation Centre for Men s Health, Aboriginal Health Council of SA Puyu Wiya Advisory. He is a member of the American College of Epidemiology, International Epidemiological Association, Society for Epidemiological Research, The Obesity Society (Fellow), Society of Behavioral Medicine, American Diabetes Association, Royal Society for Public Health (Fellow) and New York Academy of Sciences. As an international leader in population health, Mark contributes to grants review for the NHMRC and ARC, Health Research Council of New Zealand and North American and European agencies. In 2017, he was Expert International Assessor for the $117M Canada 150 Research Chairs panel, in Ottawa. He contributes regularly to journal review.",Kuwait<weight>100%<bk>Waist Circumference<weight>70%<bk>Metabolic Syndrome<weight>66%<bk>Epidemiology<weight>57%<bk>Waist-Height Ratio<weight>38%<bk>Early

61585f87d7b0c43ebd75522d,Centre for Change Governance,mailto:Lain.Dare@canberra.edu.au,Lain Dare,"I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, at the University of Canberra. My current research explores the role and mechanisms for more participatory forms of governance within rural and regional communities. This includes (i) understanding the socio-political community context, including existing power relations, networks and institutions; (ii) identifying current governance arrangements and the strengths and weaknesses, including existing forms of participation across the community; iii) identifying, often in collaboration with communities, how to support positive community engagement processes in policy governance, industry and NRM contexts, and (iv) communicating the diversity of research findings into outcomes accessible by a range of audiences including policy-makers, community members and stakeholders. I have undertaken a range of projects across water management, community development, forest management and agricultural sectors.Specifically, my academic interests focus on:Community engagement strategy development and training for the forest sector and other stakeholders including NRM agencies and local government.Improving engagement between communities, decision makers and experts to promote effective decision making.Governance within regional communities. Understanding the differences between communities and how to work with communities for sustainable futures. I undertake this work in both communities and industry-based sectors.Environmental governance and its interface with national policy agendas.I was a Schlich Medallist at the Australian National University, where I completed undergraduate degree in Science (Forestry) (Honours First Class) in 1998.

61585fbed7b0c43ebd75522e,Health Research Institute,null,Rachel Davey,"Rachel is currently Professor of Health Research with over 20 years of research experience in areas related to physical activity for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. Rachel has extensive experience of conducting large-scale trials in both clinical and community settings in the area of physical activity, health and disease prevention. More recently, Rachel has focused on the use and development of ecological models that emphasize multiple levels of influence on health behaviours. She has designed and led large-scale community interventions that have resulted in sustained behaviour change and improved health. Rachel has also led pioneering research that takes an ecological approach to sustaining and improving health, such as the United Kingdom Medical Research Council funded project ""An ecological approach to promoting health-enhancing physical activity in a deprived inner-city population"" that involved detailed mapping of the environment and evaluation of the relationship between environment, physical activity and health and health outcomes. Her research takes an integrated urban ecosystem approach to evaluating the influences of the built, natural and social environments on health behaviours, health and health outcomes. Rachel currently collaborates with the international team of researchers in the 12 country IPEN study that aims to pool data from over 14000 participants across the globe to better our understanding of environmental correlates of physical activity and obesity. Empirical findings from this trans-national research on these complex interactions will help inform policy and practice for future urban designhttp://www.ipenproject.org/IPEN_adult.htmlResearchInterestsRachel s research interests focus on policy-relevant research in areas related to physical activity for health and wellbeing and on the design, delivery and evaluation of complex public health interventions. Rachel is currently undertaking research across a number of areas, including:Exploring the inter-relationship between individuals and neighbourhoods in social, cultural and physical (built and natural) environments and their impact on health and health outcomesPrimary and secondary prevention programs for cardiovascular diseasePopulation base modeling of changes in risk factors for chronic

Before moving to the University of Canberra he was Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Australian Research Council Federation Fellow at the Australian National University. He is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, former Head of the Departments of Political Science at the Universities of Oregon and Melbourne and of the Social and Political Theory program at ANU, and former editor of the Australian Journal of Political Science.Working in both political theory and empirical social science, he is best known for his contributions in the areas of democratic theory and practice and environmental politics. One of the instigators of the  deliberative turn  in democratic theory, he has published five books in this area with Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Polity Press. His work in environmental politics ranges from green political philosophy to studies of environmental discourses and movements to global climate governance, and he has published five books in this area with Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Basil Blackwell.He has also worked on comparative studies of democratization, post-positivist public policy analysis, and the history and philosophy of social science. His current research, funded by the Laureate Fellowship, emphasizes global justice, governance in the Anthropocene (an emerging epoch of instability in the Earth system), and cultural variety in deliberative practice.",ecological system<weight>100%<bk>social actor<weight>86%<bk>artificial

In particular, how do species originating from elsewhere arrive, establish and spread at new locations. The answers to these questions are critical to managing the problems posed by introduced weeds and pests. In addition, species introductions provide unique opportunities to test fundamental questions about the way ecological communities are sturctured.We use a varitey of approaches to answer these questions ranging from glasshouse experiments to large-scale field studies, all underpinned by theory and strong quantitative methods.",soil<weight>13%<bk>soil

She is a freshwater scientist who is interested in understanding how freshwater systems respond to natural and anthropogenic variations in flow, with a view to informing decision making in water resource management. Her current research projects investigate the consequences of changes in flow regimes (associated with climate change and water resource management decisions) for water quality and ecological responses. Fiona has been extensively involved in the development and implementation of condition assessment approaches for freshwater systems, having been involved in the development of most major national and regional river condition approaches.Fiona s research is complemented by working closely with Catchment Management Authorities, community organisations, indigenous groups and water resource management agencies. She was instrumental in the review of the Upper Murrumbidgee Waterwatch data, demonstrating the potential for data collected by community groups to augment other government monitoring programs. She currently leads a consortium of four government agencies and three universities to deliver the Lower Lachlan River long term environmental flow monitoring program for the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office. Fiona is a member of the Snowy Advisory Committee, the Lachlan Environmental Water Advisory Group, a board member of the ACT Landkeepers Trust and an executive member of the Upper Murrumbidgee

Simon then completed a 1 year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Canberra/Australian Antarctic Division conducting research on the construction of artificial Antarctic sediments for insitu re-colonisation experiments. On completion of his postdoctoral fellowship Simon took up a lecturing position at the University of Canberra in 2009 before accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty in 2010. Simon was promoted to Associate Professor in 2017.  Simon s research focuses on the biochemical pathways associated with the uptake and metabolism of metals and metalloids in biological systems as well as the biogeochemical cycling on metals and metalloids in ecosystems.Simon has had extensive experience in the development of analytical methods (such as LC-MS and ICP-MS and LC-ICP-MS) for the detection of metals and metal complexes in various environmental and biological specimens, including marine animals and algae, plasma, urine, whole blood, biological tissues, water, sediments and soils. Simon has participated in numerous certification trials for the development of certified reference materials for NRCC, IAEA among other institutions.His current research interests are in:- the chemical speciation of metals and metalloids in biological material (As, Sb, Hg, Sn, Se),- the application of analytical chemistry to the measurement of trace and ultratrace metals, and- understanding the transfer, biological metabolism and associated changes in the chemical form of metal and metalloids in aquatic and terrestrial environments and clinical samples.",land ice<weight>100%<bk>beryllium

615862b3d7b0c43ebd755251,Physiotherapy,null,Nicole Freene,"Nicole finished her PhD and joined the academic staff at the University of Canberra as a Clinical Assistant Professor (Physiotherapy) in 2014. Since graduating in 1997 from the University of Sydney, Nicole has worked as a physiotherapist in a number of different hospital settings in Australia and the UK such as acute and rehabilitation, public and private, urban and rural, as well as in primary health care. Her background is mainly in rehabilitation, with a more recent focus on cardiac rehabilitation, although she has worked in a number of different rehabilitation areas including pulmonary, amputee, orthopaedic and neurological. Nicole continues to work clinically in an acute hospital setting.Dr Freene has a strong interest in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease and increasing the populations  physical activity levels, particularly in middle-aged adults. This was the focus of her PhD titled Physical Activity At Home: Long-term effectiveness of a community group exercise versus physiotherapist-led home-based physical activity program in middle-aged adults . She is a founding member of the National Physiotherapy for Physical Activity group and a committee member of the Australian Cardiovascular Health and Rehabilitation Association of NSW/ACT Professional Development Committee. Nicole supervises both Honours and PhD students.

61586356d7b0c43ebd755258,"Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society",mailto:Jean-Paul.Gagnon@canberra.edu.au,Jean-Paul Gagnon,"Jean-Paul Gagnon is a philosopher of democracy specializing in democratic theory. He joined the University of Canberra at the beginning of July, 2015.He co-founded, and co-edits, the Berghahn (Oxford/New York) journal Democratic Theory and established, and now co-edits, the Palgrave Macmillan book series The Theories, Concepts and Practices of Democracy (both with Mark Chou from the Australian Catholic University).Gagnon s research into democracy is driven by three programs. The first is an ongoing empirical effort to catalog democracy s adjectives – so far 1,217 have been found in the English literature – and to inquire about what knowing these adjectives may come to mean or be used for. The second is to continue contributing to the theory of non-human democracy by trying to draw lessons for human democracies from the practices of non-human others (e.g. how do different non-human species solve collective action problems and what, from this, resonates with the theory or practice of democracy today?). The third is to contribute to globalising the history of democracy from a democratic theory perspective which interacts with what John Keane, Benjamin Isakhan, Yves Schemeil, Steve Muhlberger and Phil Paine, and Martin Bernal, among others, have been doing.His recent publications and interests span democracy s many histories (forgotten democracies, narrative, comparison, discourse analysis, epistemology, is democracy even human?), finding ways forward among a number of problems or puzzles that democracies presently face (democracies across dialogues; democracy education / civics and young people, democracy apps, critical and normative arguments, political reform), and critically theorizing the futures of democracy – those  democracies to come  (Isaiah Berlin, fiction, posthumanism, futurism, normative arguments, Anthropocene / Holocene democracy).Please contact for: - Research collaboration - PhD, Master s, Honour s supervision - AdvocacyTo view Jean-paul s The

Amanda s research focuses on risk taking behaviours among young adults. In particular, she focuses on modifiable factors that can be targeted to reduce harm. For example, her research to date has included examining the influence of drinking motives on the relationships of impulsivity/social anxiety with risky drinking (including drinking games).Amanda has also investigated mobile phone use while driving among young adults. Consistent with her targeted approach she has investigated the influence of anticipated regret and perceived risk on this behaviour.","psychology<weight>63%<bk>curriculum<weight>77%<bk>worldview<weight>36%<bk>audit<weight>35%<bk>social inequality<weight>35%<bk>Cell Phone Use<weight>100%<bk>Cell Phone<weight>91%<bk>Impulsive Behavior<weight>100%<bk>Cellular telephones<weight>85%<bk>driver<weight>22%<bk>Argentina<weight>100%<bk>New Zealand<weight>89%<bk>Canada<weight>72%<bk>participation<weight>58%<bk>university<weight>35%<bk>Text Messaging<weight>68%<bk>Exanthema<weight>74%<bk>Reward<weight>72%<bk>Drinking<weight>80%<bk>Students<weight>64%<bk>Young Adult<weight>63%<bk>Alcohol Drinking<weight>22%<bk>Alcohol Drinking in College<weight>19%<bk>Object Attachment<weight>100%<bk>female adolescent<weight>87%<bk>Self Concept<weight>78%<bk>self-esteem<weight>65%<bk>Psychology<weight>61%<bk>Drinking Behavior<weight>100%<bk>Anxiety<weight>19%<bk>Alcohols<weight>66%<bk>student<weight>12%<bk>health risk<weight>11%<bk>Music<weight>75%<bk>song<weight>74%<bk>delinquency<weight>100%<bk>young adult<weight>85%<bk>Risk-Taking<weight>83%<bk>adolescent<weight>59%<bk>Age Groups<weight>22%<bk>Highway accidents<weight>100%<bk>Health Occupations<weight>100%<bk>role play<weight>81%<bk>Health<weight>58%<bk>Physical therapy<weight>56%<bk>Underage Drinking<weight>100%<bk>Control theory<weight>94%<bk>Adolescent Behavior<weight>30%<bk>Longitudinal Studies<weight>100%<bk>Depression<weight>78%<bk>N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine<weight>13%<bk>Patient Health Questionnaire<weight>12%<bk>Personality<weight>26%<bk>Retention (Psychology)<weight>100%<bk>Learning<weight>67%<bk>Duty of care<weight>100%<bk>alcohol<weight>56%<bk>sleep<weight>13%<bk>Medically Unexplained Symptoms<weight>100%<bk>Mental Health<weight>65%<bk>Amphetamine<weight>59%<bk>Cannabis<weight>58%",Associate Professor,Canberra,Drinking<weight>100%<bk>Students<weight>84%<bk>Impulsive Behavior<weight>52%<bk>Young Adult<weight>49%<bk>Cell Phone<weight>46%<bk>Drinking Behavior<weight>41%<bk>Cell Phone Use<weight>40%<bk>Text Messaging<weight>31%<bk>Psychology<weight>29%<bk>Alcohols<weight>26%<bk>Anxiety<weight>22%<bk>Health Occupations<weight>17%<bk>Object Attachment<weight>17%<bk>Medically Unexplained Symptoms<weight>16%<bk>Argentina<weight>12%<bk>Music<weight>15%<bk>Retention (Psychology)<weight>14%<bk>Underage Drinking<weight>14%<bk>New Zealand<weight>11%<bk>Risk-Taking<weight>13%<bk>Exanthema<weight>13%<bk>Self Concept<weight>13%<bk>Reward<weight>13%<bk>Canada<weight>9%<bk>Depression<weight>11%<bk>Fear<weight>11%<bk>Longitudinal Studies<weight>11%<bk>Mental Health<weight>10%<bk>Learning<weight>10%<bk>Personality<weight>9%<bk>Amphetamine<weight>9%<bk>Age Groups<weight>9%<bk>Cannabis<weight>9%<bk>Problem Behavior<weight>9%<bk>Interviews<weight>9%<bk>Mothers<weight>8%<bk>Reading<weight>7%<bk>Brain<weight>6%<bk>Health<weight>6%<bk>university<weight>27%<bk>young adult<weight>22%<bk>psychology<weight>19%<bk>Duty of care<weight>18%<bk>student<weight>17%<bk>driver<weight>15%<bk>participation<weight>15%<bk>female adolescent<weight>14%<bk>song<weight>14%<bk>alcohol<weight>14%<bk>role play<weight>14%<bk>delinquency<weight>13%<bk>self-esteem<weight>11%<bk>adolescent<weight>10%<bk>profession<weight>9%<bk>health<weight>8%<bk>experiment<weight>8%<bk>psychology student<weight>7%<bk>curriculum<weight>7%<bk>online survey<weight>6%<bk>interview<weight>5%<bk>age group<weight>5%,,UC_6158637ad7b0c43ebd75525a

6158646fd7b0c43ebd755261,Science,null,Darren Giling,"Email: Darren.Giling@canberra.edu.auDr Darren Giling is a Senior Research Fellow in Quantitative Ecology in the Institute for Applied Ecology at the University of Canberra and CSIRO Land and Water. Darren is an ecosystem and community ecologist with broad interests in the relationships between biodiversity, food-web structure, and the functioning of ecosystems.Darren s applied research seeks to understand how environmental changes and management decisions influence freshwater, riparian, and floodplain habitats. He studies how land-use and climate change affect biological community structure and organic matter storage and dynamics in river and lakes. For instance, his work has shown that replanting native riparian vegetation along Australian agricultural streams improves stream health by restoring links between the terrestrial and aquatic environment. He has also used lake enclosures to experimentally demonstrate how extreme storms can induce algal blooms that drastically increase rates of lake primary production and respiration.Darren is currently working with a range of stakeholders in the Murray-Darling Basin to develop models for predicting how environmental flows influence the functioning of river ecosystems at broad spatial scales.",metabolome<weight>100%<bk>nutrient enrichment<weight>96%<bk>eutrophication<weight>93%<bk>metabolite<weight>72%<bk>lakes<weight>100%<bk>productivity<weight>100%<bk>biodiversity<weight>51%<bk>ecosystems<weight>89%<bk>ecosystem research<weight>100%<bk>gymnosperm<weight>23%<bk>Herbivory<weight>100%<bk>Biodiversity<weight>34%<bk>Arthropods<weight>79%<bk>Food Chain<weight>100%<bk>Pest Control<weight>8%<bk>food webs<weight>95%<bk>food web<weight>80%<bk>grasslands<weight>78%<bk>invertebrate<weight>70%<bk>invertebrates<weight>68%<bk>ecosystem boundary<weight>19%<bk>ecology<weight>18%<bk>Ecosystems<weight>74%<bk>global change<weight>100%<bk>niche<weight>88%<bk>ecosystem<weight>70%<bk>ecosystem response<weight>25%<bk>Fungi<weight>95%<bk>latitudinal gradient<weight>85%<bk>leaf litter<weight>83%<bk>fungus<weight>60%<bk>energy flux<weight>98%<bk>energy<weight>53%<bk>predation<weight>41%<bk>rivers<weight>92%<bk>Rivers<weight>88%<bk>Ecosystem<weight>80%<bk>Carbon<weight>71%<bk>ecological function<weight>100%<bk>ecosystem function<weight>89%<bk>food<weight>79%<bk>arthropods<weight>30%<bk>biological diversity<weight>29%<bk>lake<weight>71%<bk>ecosystem respiration<weight>39%<bk>gross primary productivity<weight>37%<bk>metabolism<weight>100%<bk>flagship species<weight>100%<bk>Ailuropoda melanoleuca<weight>59%<bk>conservation programs<weight>25%<bk>enclosure experiment<weight>100%<bk>Metabolism<weight>100%<bk>Lakes<weight>77%<bk>thermocline<weight>69%<bk>riparian areas<weight>100%<bk>riparian zone<weight>98%<bk>plankton<weight>100%<bk>algal bloom<weight>92%<bk>mesocosm<weight>89%<bk>mixed layer<weight>76%<bk>light intensity<weight>58%<bk>Dissolved oxygen<weight>67%<bk>Oxygen<weight>63%<bk>Availability<weight>18%<bk>subsidy system<weight>100%<bk>Organic carbon<weight>85%<bk>subsidies<weight>66%<bk>subsidy<weight>30%<bk>organic carbon<weight>30%<bk>dissolved organic matter<weight>100%<bk>Biological materials<weight>89%<bk>ecosystem process<weight>78%<bk>agricultural land<weight>54%<bk>plant community<weight>79%<bk>plant communities<weight>79%<bk>forecasting<weight>65%<bk>vegetation<weight>87%<bk>riparian vegetation<weight>86%<bk>stoichiometry<weight>79%<bk>lowlands<weight>58%<bk>Cherax destructor<weight>100%<bk>resource<weight>40%<bk>freshwater crayfish<weight>85%<bk>crayfish<weight>77%<bk>Eudyptula minor<weight>100%<bk>penguins<weight>78%<bk>anthropogenic activities<weight>68%<bk>nesting sites<weight>67%<bk>breakwater<weight>47%,Research Fellow,Canberra,ecosystem<weight>100%<bk>biodiversity<weight>78%<bk>riparian vegetation<weight>61%<bk>food web<weight>56%<bk>ecosystem process<weight>38%<bk>enclosure experiment<weight>36%<bk>global change<weight>35%<bk>metabolism<weight>35%<bk>invertebrate<weight>33%<bk>ecosystem research<weight>33%<bk>lake<weight>32%<bk>subsidy system<weight>32%<bk>loss<weight>30%<bk>vegetation<weight>29%<bk>leaf litter<weight>27%<bk>ecosystem function<weight>26%<bk>crayfish<weight>25%<bk>agricultural land<weight>25%<bk>dissolved organic matter<weight>24%<bk>latitudinal gradient<weight>22%<bk>riparian zone<weight>21%<bk>nutrient enrichment<weight>21%<bk>energy flux<weight>19%<bk>stoichiometry<weight>19%<bk>productivity<weight>19%<bk>restoration<weight>19%<bk>thermocline<weight>19%<bk>primary production<weight>18%<bk>catchment<weight>18%<bk>lake ecosystem<weight>18%<bk>niche<weight>17%<bk>plant community<weight>17%<bk>resource<weight>17%<bk>canopy<weight>17%<bk>metabolite<weight>16%<bk>experiment<weight>16%<bk>fungus<weight>15%<bk>effect<weight>15%<bk>conceptual framework<weight>15%<bk>grassland<weight>15%<bk>photodegradation<weight>14%<bk>policy<weight>14%<bk>forecasting<weight>14%<bk>breakwater<weight>13%<bk>diet<weight>13%<bk>nest site<weight>12%<bk>macroinvertebrate<weight>12%<bk>science<weight>11%<bk>ecology<weight>11%<bk>lake water<weight>11%,,UC_6158646fd7b0c43ebd755261

He was born in Iran, 1946, and received a PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, USA, and has taught in a number of American universities, including Columbia University.The investigative and speculative aspect of Hartoonian s research in architectural history/theory draws from Walter Benjamin s drive to save the tradition from its tendency to conform. Central to his critical investigation of architectural history is the modalities of the crisis of theobjectand its implications for the tectonics. Starting from the historicity of the project of Modernity, Hartoonian s research also pursues the impact of modernization and globalization for the architecture of countries such as Australia, China, Iran, etc. Hartoonian teaches architectural history and theory and design studio in the School of Design and Built Environment, Faculty of Arts and Design, and supervises 5 research students. He has taught at the Columbia University and other American schools of architecture. He was the 2016 and 2013 invited Professor of Architecture history at Tongji University, Shanghai. Books include;Time, History and Architecture, 2017,Architecture and Spectacle: a critique(2012),The Mental Life of the Architectural Historian(2013/11),Walter Benjamin and Architecture, ed.

615866f9d7b0c43ebd755281,Science,mailto:Jurian.Hoogewerff@canberra.edu.au,Jurian Hoogewerff,"Dr Jurian Hoogewerff is presently the Director of the National Centre for Forensic Studies (NCFS) at the University of Canberra. The NCFS is a collaboration between the UC, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Canberra Institute of Technology (CiT).Dr Hoogewerff studied geochemistry (M.Sc.) and volcanology (Ph.D.) at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands (1984-1993). The emphasis of his work was, and still is, using inorganic elemental and isotope ratio analysis to trace any natural material to its geographical origin.During his PhD research he investigated the contribution of the Australian crust to volcanism in Eastern Indonesia. In 1993 Dr Hoogewerff joined the Department of Health Sciences of University Maastricht to teach environmental sciences and develop tracers for the origin of pollutants from their source to environmental and biological targets including human tissues.Dr Hoogewerff transferred to the Geotechnical Institute Arsenal Research in Vienna in 1996 where he continued his environmental exposure research, combining epidemiological data with newly created geochemical maps. Here he also started to apply his techniques for forensic casework and archaeological provenancing. His study on 5000 year old ""Otzi"" was the first isotope study on the Tyrolean Iceman.With an EU grant in 1999 Dr Hoogewerff established the global analytical forensic network NITECRIME that included major national forensic research institutes like the NFI, BKA, US Customs and FBI. In 2006 NITECRIME almagated with the Forensic Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry network and Dr Hoogewerff was involved in its management until 2014. In 2000 Dr Hoogewerff moved to the Institute of Food Research in Norwich to manage their isotope facility for food forensics applications and human metabolism studies. Together with other colleagues he initiated the EU funded TRACE project (Euro20M) using the compositional links between soil and food for determining the geographical origin of food products to combat counterfeiting.Dr Hoogewerff was Senior Lecturer at the University of East Anglia in Norwich UK from 2006 to 2011 and developed and managed their ""Forensic and Investigative Chemistry"" four year MChem program. In September 2011 he relocated to Dunedin in New Zealand and first served one year as part-time Chief Scientist and Co-Director of Oritain Ltd. and then continued as Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Otago to expand their Forensic Analytical Science Program until December 2014.In January 2015 Dr Hoogewerff moved to the NCFS. He convenes a number of on-campus and online units e.g.  Environmental and Forensic Geochemistry  and  Forensic Chemistry  and is the course convener of the Online Forensic Science MSc.Dr. Hoogewerff is actively engaged in forensic casework and contributed to 70+ scientific papers and over 80 conference presentations including many invited keynotes.Research interestsResearch interests:Forensic comparison and provenancing of soils using soil databases.Analysis of micro-plastics in soil for environmental and forensic applications.Mechanisms controlling forensic soil transfer.Bioacoustics to monitor insect activity and succession in and around cadavers.Detection of illicit graves sites and caches using drome imaging.Forensic multispectral photography.

The Play Activation Network aims to:Enable and support play in its many forms;Promote engagement in play across the lifespan for citizens of the ACT and regions;Increase knowledge of the role of play as a form of cultural and environmental practice;Foster a culture of positive collaboration, exchange, partnerships and cross-disciplinary practice.To achieve these aims, the Network engages in:ActivationAdvocacyCollaborationPromotionResearchThe Play Activation Network ACT is facilitated by the Play, Creativity and Wellbeing Project in the Centre for Creative and Cultural Research at the University of Canberra.Coordinator - Play, Creativity and Wellbeing Symposium: Play for a Vital and Sustainable CityThe Play in the City Symposium is an annual Symposium that explores the potential of play in cities.Over two days we present an exciting national line up of speakers whose pioneering work in urban design, place-making, creativity, the arts and wellbeing will inspire you to think

61586736d7b0c43ebd755283,Canberra Law School,null,Janet Hope,"Current teaching: Criminal Justice (convenor), Criminal Law and Procedure (Semester 2 2020)Janet earned first class honours degrees in biochemistry and law from the Australian National University as a National Undergraduate Scholar during the early 1990s. She won the 1996 Blackburn Medal for Research in Law for a paper on constitutional rights and criminal due process, which was subsequently published in the Federal Law Review and cited in a judgement of the High Court of Australia. As an undergraduate Janet worked as a Research Associate to Chief Justice Miles of the ACT Supreme Court, conducting an investigation into the historic role of the Federal Court of Australia as a court of criminal appeal for the ACT. Janet qualified to practise in 1997 and worked for several years as a barrister in Australia and New Zealand, primarily in conflict resolution, administrative, human rights and employment law.Janet received her PhD in Law from the Australian National University in 2005, winning an open national award for communicating scholarly information to lay audiences. From 2000 to 2009 she was a pioneer of efforts to translate the open source model from software to biotechnology, a key agenda item for scholars working to develop socially just models of intellectual property and innovation management. Hope s international prize-winning 2008 book, BioBazaar (Harvard University Press), was the first systematic exposition of the open source model outside the software context, offering a detailed conceptual framework to support further development of the model in biotech and elsewhere. During the period 2005-2009 Janet was employed in the Australian National University s Regulatory Institutions Network (RegNet), initially as an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow. and later as Senior Fellow. Between 2005 and 2009 she led two successful ARC Discovery Project grant applications in the field of open source biotechnology.The broad impact of Janet s work in this field was evidenced by invitations to speak at numerous international conferences and workshops and by citations in a wide variety of publication types, from academic books and refereed journals in several disciplines, through reports of international think tanks, foundations and intergovernmental organisations such as the OECD, to international specialist and generalist periodicals including The Economist. Janet also contributed to emerging practice by organising international events, consulting and advising on implementation of the open source biotech model in international organisations and public and private sectors in Australia, Canada and the US, and serving in leadership roles in two international non-profit organisations.In 2011, Janet s volunteer experience over 20 years advocating for victims of crime in the spheres of disability, health, mental health and financial compensation led her to step out of academia and retrain as a professional coach. From 2013 to 2020 she built a thriving  international micro-business  serving hundreds of individual and organisational clients around the world, primarily in the higher education sector. Janet holds the International Coach Federation s senior practitioner credential (PCC), has held leadership roles within her local ACT branch and is a founding member of the European Mentoring and Coaching Council (Asia-Pacific Region). She is a member of the Australian Psychological Society s Interest Group on Coaching Psychology, a non-practising member of the ACT Law Society and a long-standing member of both the ANU Dialogue Group and the Canberra Restorative Community Network. Her emerging research interests relate to the intersection of individual trauma and organisational systems and the development of a coaching approach to legal research practice.",Open Source<weight>80%<bk>Biotechnology<weight>100%<bk>Software Development<weight>15%<bk>Life Sciences<weight>28%<bk>Innovators<weight>10%<bk>Intellectual Property Rights<weight>100%<bk>Conceptual Framework<weight>67%<bk>Innovation<weight>49%<bk>Price Fixing<weight>30%<bk>Biotechnology Industry<weight>30%<bk>knowledge economy<weight>100%<bk>capitalist society<weight>73%<bk>society<weight>57%<bk>market<weight>47%<bk>Licensing<weight>74%<bk>Open Source Software<weight>26%<bk>Agricultural Biotechnology<weight>20%<bk>Biomedicine<weight>19%<bk>Howard Barker<weight>100%<bk>Drugs<weight>53%<bk>Industry<weight>79%<bk>Technology Transfer<weight>31%<bk>Licensure<weight>23%<bk>genetic modification<weight>100%<bk>New Zealand<weight>52%<bk>institutional structure<weight>22%<bk>critical analysis<weight>19%<bk>crop<weight>11%<bk>Administration of Justice<weight>100%<bk>History<weight>60%<bk>Territories<weight>96%<bk>Court of Appeals<weight>44%<bk>appeals system<weight>34%<bk>Criminal Matters<weight>29%<bk>constitutional issues<weight>28%<bk>Genetic Modification<weight>91%<bk>Part Introduction<weight>47%<bk>legislative jurisdiction<weight>100%<bk>Administration of criminal justice<weight>92%<bk>Fair trial<weight>78%<bk>accused<weight>58%<bk>Criminal Justice Systems<weight>55%,Senior Lecturer,Canberra,genetic modification<weight>56%<bk>legislative jurisdiction<weight>33%<bk>New Zealand<weight>16%<bk>Administration of criminal justice<weight>31%<bk>Fair trial<weight>26%<bk>knowledge economy<weight>22%<bk>accused<weight>19%<bk>Criminal Justice Systems<weight>18%<bk>capitalist society<weight>16%<bk>Territories<weight>14%<bk>efficiency<weight>13%<bk>society<weight>12%<bk>legislation<weight>12%<bk>reform<weight>11%<bk>market<weight>10%<bk>institutional structure<weight>10%<bk>human being<weight>9%<bk>Court of Appeals<weight>6%<bk>food<weight>6%<bk>regulation<weight>5%<bk>appeals system<weight>5%<bk>Open Source<weight>25%<bk>Biotechnology<weight>21%<bk>Intellectual Property Rights<weight>28%<bk>Conceptual Framework<weight>19%<bk>Licensing<weight>18%<bk>Innovation<weight>16%<bk>Innovators<weight>11%<bk>Life Sciences<weight>10%<bk>Price Fixing<weight>8%<bk>Minimum Standards<weight>8%<bk>Software Development<weight>8%<bk>Market Order<weight>8%<bk>Uruguay Round<weight>8%<bk>Biotechnology Industry<weight>7%<bk>Public Interest<weight>7%<bk>Patenting<weight>6%<bk>Open Source Software<weight>6%<bk>Free Market<weight>6%<bk>Economists<weight>5%<bk>International Markets<weight>5%<bk>Goods<weight>5%<bk>Patents<weight>5%<bk>Agricultural Biotechnology<weight>5%<bk>Howard Barker<weight>31%<bk>Genetic Modification<weight>19%<bk>Drugs<weight>16%<bk>History<weight>14%<bk>Part Introduction<weight>10%<bk>Deregulation<weight>8%<bk>Backlash<weight>7%<bk>Gene<weight>7%<bk>Cultural Heritage<weight>6%<bk>Liability<weight>5%<bk>Isolation<weight>5%,,UC_61586736d7b0c43ebd755283

He is keen to explore the contextual factors that are most effective for IT system designs and innovation; exploiting local knowledge, assets and socio-technical artefacts to provide maximum value. Dr Imran s work includes designing and evaluating IT services for different organisations and cultures, children online protection, organizational/societal transformations by ICT, and most importantly the short- and long-term implications and influence of IT in shaping the societies of the future. His research challenges the existing myths and theories applied to the adoption of ICT, primarily developed and used in the first world. His research has thus proven to bring real-world applications to the table, something that cemented its importance and relevance in the eyes of the research community.Dr Imran has garnered over a decade of academic experience in two of Australia s leading Universities (Group of Eight) before moving to UC and has published in top-tier journals and conferences in IS as well as in multiple practitioner outlets and industry reports. He has received several national/international competitive grants within the short span of his academic career, following sixteen years of challenging and versatile service in a military career as a Signals officer, in command, instructional and staff role. Dr Imran s research interest and transition to academia were highly motivated by his passion and personal experiences (as an IT Manager). His expertise became invaluable for research in understanding and providing a rich insight into the socio-cultural context using multiple lenses, resulting in interdisciplinary research opportunities.Dr Imran is a fellow of the Australian Computer Society and a member of a number of professional bodies. Dr Imran has received several awards and recognition for his career achievement including ANU Vice Chancellor s Award for Community

He is an inaugural member of the National Capital Design Review Panel, the peak advisory group to the Australian Government and ACT Government on major development proposals in areas of significance in Canberra as Australia s national capital. He founded Architecture Research Alliance, an international platform for research on contemporary issues in architecture and urbanism.EXECUTIVE ROLESBetween 2002 and 2011 Jasper was Partner in the New York architecture and urban design firm of Cooper Robertson & Partners where he directed many of the firm s major urban design and complex architecture projects as Partner including completion of some 24 research reports for state and federal government and not-for-profit bodies leading to $4.8 billion in building and infrastructure policy outcomes. Different from most commercial firms, Cooper Robertson focuses on government and institutional clients at policy formulation, strategic planning, program development, feasibility, and institutional planning phases. Brought into the firm and made Partner as part of a corporate succession plan, Jasper oversaw with other partners growth of the firm including doubling of architecture staff from 60 to 120 full-time salaried staff and commensurate growth to some 240 contracted sub-consultants, an office annual operating budget increase from $10 to $18 million USD, with annual billing including sub consultants of $35 million USD, and diversification of project type. His change management responsibilities extended to expansion of geographic reach resulting in assignments undertaken across the United States, and out to Canada, South America, several European Union countries, the Middle East, and Africa. With other partners, Jasper oversaw commensurate business systems growth in design, technology, marketing, human resource management, and finance.At Cooper Robertson he held executive leadership roles in corporate management and marketing committees in addition to project director responsibilities on complex institutional, government, and urban scale projects. While at Cooper Robertson Jasper directed many of the firms major institutional and urban scale projects.His clients included mayors and government agencies as they sought to address aging infrastructure, poorly designed public realms, changing land use, and new cultural programs. He counts among his clients Baltimore Development Corporation, City of Detroit, City of Miami, City of Sarasota, and Washington DC Office of City Planning. He directed projects for university presidents and their boards as they sought to imagine and plan for their futures including Presidents Richard Levin, Yale University; Jean-Lou Chameau, California Institute of Technology; Lee Bollinger, Columbia University; John DeGioia, Georgetown University; Samuel Stanley, State University of New York at Stony Brook; Donna Shalala, University of Miami; Ronald Peterson, Johns Hopkins Medicine.RESEARCHProfessor Jasper is a specialist in 20th-century European and American architecture. He approaches architecture as a conceptual and material enquiry and his international research achievements rest on a large portfolio of work that investigates three strands in architecture practice and theory. The first strand engages in the critical analysis and re-interpretation of modernist architectural discourses with a particular emphasis on the second half of the 20th century. The second focuses on theories of architecture composition at multiple scales and temporal settings: from individual buildings, to group form, to precinct and city scales. The third strand concerns the conceptualisation and delivery of complex architectural and urban scale projects. This research performance is expanded by contributions to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge through his teaching in international and national settings and through academic and professional engagement activities. International and national refereed publications, grants, conference presentations, and committee work in peak bodies with national policy impact demarcate these contributions and ensure their impact.He was Visiting Scholar (2015) at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation, and Visiting Scholar (2019, 2013) at the American Academy in Rome. He has published extensively in the discipline s peak academic journals and lectured broadly giving peer-reviewed papers in conferences in Abu Dhabi, Adelaide, Antwerp, Auckland, Brussels, Canberra, Copenhagen, Ghent, Helsinki, Launceston, Melbourne, New York City, Paris, Seoul, Stockholm, Sydney, Tampere, València, Venice, and Wellington. He is the author of Architectural Aesthetic Speculations, Deleuze on Art and the forthcoming Architectural Possibilities in the Work of Peter Eisenman (Routledge)and Trajectories in Architecture (Routledge).He is currently working on several long-term projects including a revised account of modernist architectural knowledge, a history of the architectural plan as conceptual device, and investigations into resilient urban scale form with an initial focus on multi-unit housing,TEACHINGJasper s teaching practice has been delivered in a body of work distinctive for its intellectual rigor, scholarly depth, and discipline impact. His teaching has been delivered through advanced architecture studios, major project urban-scale studios; advanced seminars in architecture formal analysis and composition. He has also led and taught in the professional practice and elective studies streams. Professor Jasper s teaching develops translational knowledge across three domains: form generation, architecture knowledge, and complex urban-scale design.In the period 2017-2019 his teaching received an averaged overall satisfaction with unit quality InterFace Student Experience Questionnaire score of 97%, well above the 78% UC average.Starting in 2011, he has led the internationalization of the UC architecture program, initiating and securing funding for a series of postgraduate overseas research studios based in Beijing (2011, 2012), Venice (2014), and Tokyo (2015-). The Tokyo-based postgraduate unit celebrated its fifth consecutive year in 2019 and is now an established and distinguishing part of the curriculum, the program currently suspended due to COVID19 related travel restrictions. He has been Master of Architecture Course Convenor from December 2015 and in that capacity led the course in the implementation of a revised curriculum from 2016 and over the national accreditation reporting period of Semester 2 2016 through Semester 1 2018. In the October 2018 national visiting panel review the University of Canberra s Master of Architecture course received the best accreditation outcomes in the program s history, receiving the maximum five-year accreditation with only modest (non structural) action items to address. He has contributed to delivery coordination of the undergraduate architecture course as Acting Discipline Lead Bachelor of the Built Environment (Architecture) 2019-2021.",Lenses<weight>19%<bk>Trajectories<weight>59%<bk>Resuscitation<weight>100%<bk>Chemical analysis<weight>34%<bk>Studios<weight>43%<bk>Teaching<weight>39%<bk>Composite materials<weight>52%<bk>Students<weight>14%<bk>Curricula<weight>100%<bk>Education<weight>100%<bk>Lead<weight>17%<bk>Ports and harbors<weight>100%<bk>Agglomeration<weight>39%<bk>Architectural design<weight>25%<bk>Diamonds<weight>100%<bk>Painting<weight>38%<bk>Plastics<weight>71%<bk>Experiments<weight>18%<bk>Piet Mondrian<weight>100%<bk>Canvas<weight>35%<bk>John Hejduk<weight>100%<bk>Theo Van Doesburg<weight>39%<bk>Apartment Blocks<weight>35%<bk>Anthony Caro<weight>100%<bk>plastic<weight>99%<bk>project<weight>67%<bk>Modernist<weight>66%<bk>Ellsworth Kelly<weight>51%<bk>Museums<weight>100%<bk>Geometry<weight>100%<bk>Speculation<weight>60%<bk>Olivetti<weight>57%<bk>Formal Differences<weight>81%<bk>Genealogy<weight>51%<bk>Gilles Deleuze<weight>67%<bk>Art<weight>93%<bk>Aesthetics<weight>40%<bk>Patents and inventions<weight>38%<bk>Utopian Thought<weight>79%<bk>Utopia<weight>39%<bk>Manuscripts<weight>37%<bk>Louis Kahn<weight>100%<bk>Aesthetic Criteria<weight>47%<bk>Urban History<weight>100%<bk>Artwork<weight>96%<bk>Architectural Plans<weight>81%<bk>Modernist Architecture<weight>100%<bk>Assays<weight>22%<bk>teaching practice<weight>100%<bk>architect<weight>78%<bk>provocation<weight>45%<bk>university teaching<weight>43%<bk>beauty<weight>40%<bk>Folding<weight>100%<bk>Fold<weight>80%<bk>Two-Dimensional Space<weight>25%<bk>Philosophical Aesthetics<weight>22%<bk>Critical History<weight>21%<bk>Urban Design<weight>100%<bk>Urban Studies<weight>40%<bk>Methodology<weight>37%<bk>History of Architecture<weight>36%<bk>Formal Analysis<weight>33%<bk>Painterly<weight>67%<bk>Theory of Architecture<weight>82%<bk>Temporality<weight>37%<bk>Spatial Effects<weight>88%<bk>Close Reading<weight>30%<bk>Thematic<weight>29%<bk>Giuseppe Terragni<weight>100%<bk>History<weight>73%<bk>Historical Analysis<weight>66%<bk>Realism<weight>81%<bk>Causality<weight>28%,Professor,Canberra,John Hejduk<weight>100%<bk>Peter Eisenman<weight>77%<bk>Gilles Deleuze<weight>76%<bk>Louis Kahn<weight>71%<bk>Aesthetics<weight>53%<bk>Piet Mondrian<weight>51%<bk>Temporality<weight>49%<bk>Spatial Effects<weight>46%<bk>Art<weight>44%<bk>Modernist Architecture<weight>43%<bk>Folding<weight>35%<bk>Speculation<weight>35%<bk>Utopian Thought<weight>35%<bk>Urban Design<weight>29%<bk>Realism<weight>29%<bk>Philosophy<weight>28%<bk>History<weight>28%<bk>Theory of Art<weight>28%<bk>Formal Analysis<weight>28%<bk>Painterly<weight>24%<bk>Theory of Architecture<weight>24%<bk>Aesthetic Criteria<weight>23%<bk>Fold<weight>23%<bk>Two-Dimensional Space<weight>22%<bk>Geometry<weight>22%<bk>Giuseppe Terragni<weight>22%<bk>Canvas<weight>21%<bk>Formal Differences<weight>21%<bk>Cubists<weight>20%<bk>Modernist<weight>19%<bk>Methodology<weight>19%<bk>Triad<weight>18%<bk>Plateau<weight>18%<bk>Anthony Caro<weight>18%<bk>Architectural History<weight>18%<bk>Artwork<weight>17%<bk>Constructivist<weight>17%<bk>Schizophrenia<weight>17%<bk>Utopia<weight>17%<bk>Manuscripts<weight>16%<bk>Invention<weight>16%<bk>Close Reading<weight>15%<bk>Manifestation<weight>14%<bk>Historical Analysis<weight>14%<bk>Thematic<weight>14%<bk>Architectural Practice<weight>14%,,UC_6158685bd7b0c43ebd75528f

615868f5d7b0c43ebd755299,Psychology,null,Associate Professor Phil Kavanagh,"I am an Associate Professor in Clinical Psychology and Course Convenor for the Master of Clinical Psychology course at the University of Canberra (UC). I lecture across the undergraduate, honours, and master s courses at UC and provide research and clinical supervision to students. My previous roles include: Associate Professor of Evolutionary Psychology and Head of Psychology (ISN Psychology); Principal ISN Research Fellow (Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health); Acting Associate Head of School: Research, Discipline Head: Psychology, and Program Director for the Master of Psychology (Clinical) program (University of South Australia [UniSA]). While at UniSA I lectured across both the undergraduate and postgraduate psychology programs, provided research supervision to honours, master s, and PhD students, and clinical supervision to students in the master s of clinical psychology program. I am still an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of South Australia.I completed my degree at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch (NZ) in 1999 as a ""mature age"" student, graduating in 2002 with a BSc(Hons) 1st class in Psychology. From there, I went on to complete both a PhD and Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology (PGDipClinPsych) concurrently; completing both in 2008. Shortly after completing my qualifications, I started a conjoined position with Central Queensland University as a Lecturer in Clinical Psychology and Queensland Health as a Service Evaluation and Research Coordinator for Evolve Therapeutic Services (ETS). My professional experiences have been varied and diverse, covering university settings, hospital settings, residential treatment facilities, clinical research projects, and clinical practice. I have worked in government organisations, non-government organisations, and privately.My research interests are in the areas that overlap between social, personality, and clinical psychology. I have two intersecting streams of research that I have been developing to lead toward a program of research investigating psychopathology from an evolutionary psychology perspective. My first stream of research is testing and expanding sociometer theory—an evolutionary theory about the role and function of self-esteem, how it is associated with social acceptance and rejection, and how this might influence subsequent mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). My second stream of research is examining the darker sides of personality, specifically the behavioural and psychological correlates and consequences of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. This second stream of research is also couched in an evolutionary framework and influenced by Life History Theory. These two streams of research, alongside my interest and practice in clinical psychology have led me to start investigating the aetiology of psychopathology from a life history theory

61586920d7b0c43ebd75529a,Health Office,null,Richard Keegan,"BiographyRichard completed his MSc and PhD at Loughborough University, and before that, a degree in Psychology at the University of Bristol. His research focuses on four key areas: motivational processes in sport and exercise; physical literacy; applied sport psychology practice; and psychological resilience. He has published 28 peer reviewed academic papers, 2 books and 13 book chapters, as well as reports for state and Federal governments.Richard is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, and has served as Chair of Teaching and Learning in two university departments. His approach to education focuses on stimulating the co-creation of innovative and science-inspired products, as an explicit reaction against casting students as passive consumers of information: helping students to develop the key employability skills of critical, independent thinking, and reflective practice. His teaching spans face-to-face delivery, as well as online and flexible platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, GoogleDocs (to host open data collection); and blogging platforms to encourage public engagement.Richard is a qualified sport and exercise psychologist, who has worked with athletes across the full range of levels (from beginners to world champions), and in a range of sports (from athletics and snow-sports to motorsport and officiating). His book  Being a Sport Psychologist  focuses on understanding the role of practicing sport psychologists, and he retains strong links with the AIS and other local service providers. This experience helps to ensure the real-world applicability of Richard s research, as well as embedding work-integrated learning opportunities in his teaching.In his spare time he enjoys playing squash and touch football, and spending time with his young family.Areas of TeachingRichard teaches all the psychology-related units within the discipline of sport and exercise sciences; including:*Sport and Exercise Psychology (Year 1, Semester 1)*Sport and Performance Psychology (Year 2, Semester 2)*Resilience and Decision Making (Year 3 and/or Masters, Semester 1)He has also taught, and continues to contribute to the following units:*Motor Control and Skill Acquisition (Year 1, Semester 1) *Research Methods for Honours (Honours, Semester 1)*Research Methods for Masters (Masters in High Performance Sport); and*Neuromuscular Conditions and Rehabilitation (Ex, Phys. Year 4)Research InterestsRichard s research focuses on four key areas: *motivation; *physical literacy; *psychological resilience; and*applied sport psychology practiceRichard is the HDR convenor for both the Faculty of Health and UC-RISE, and spent two years establishing the research seminars series run by both groups.

615869aed7b0c43ebd75529f,Psychology,null,Sally Kelty,"I am a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Canberra (UC), specialising in criminal psychology. I have worked in the public sector (Justice Department), private sector, NGOs and within university research institutes. I have an emerging track record in high-impact consultancy and contract research producing over 30 academic peer-reviewed publications, 20 Industry papers, and have been awarded over $480,000 in research funding. I have been invited to deliver keynote presentations on my work, in the UK, New Zealand and within Australia.My current research is in the following areas:The investigation and disruption of online child exploitation material     Mental wellbeing, resilience and stress management in forensic science and medical practitioners Creating psychological profiles of top performers to inform recruitment, early career and leadership training programsGrievance escalation, stalking and tech facilitated abuseMy research has real world impact and involves being embedded within industry. I have considerable experience working successfully in multi-disciplinary teams of practitioners, experts and researchers. The impact of the research findings from the teams I have led, or worked within,have changed sexual assault investigation policy in three states,amended the law in respect of what evidence is sufficient in order to build a prosecution brief for sexual assaultin two states, and has advised law enforcement agencies on best practice in the recruitment and early career development training for forensic scientists. I have supervised 4 PhD students to completion at the University of Tasmania (UTAS). I currently supervise 4 PhD students (2 at UC, 2 at UTAS).Between 2009 to 2015 I worked with the Australian Police Commissioners Advisory Agency and Specialist Forensic and Policing Advisory Groups to unpack effective multidisciplinary working practices and sharing of information between law enforcement, scientific, medical and legal practitioners. The critical decision model created from this workwon me a national award from the National Institute of Forensic Science and recognition from the Australian and New Zealand Policing Advisory Commissioners Board. I currently teach this method of critical decision modelling to my students enrolled in the Forensic Psychology Unit I deliver at UC.I lecture in my specialist area of Forensic and Criminal Psychology and team teach into a novel case-based applied introductory psychology unit which I developed at UC in 2018. Since 2016, on an annual basis I have been awarded a Vice-Chancellors Excellence Award or nominated for a University or Faculty Teaching Award or Citation.I am currently a Member of the Indigenous Australians Completions Taskforce at UC.I currently advise the Australian Federal Policy on requirement practice for their specialist forensic scientists. I am also currently at the draft stage of collaboratively developing with the Forensic Laboratory in Canberra a holistic stress and wellbeing model to reduce burnout and psychological trauma in their Digital Forensic, Crime Scene and Disaster Victim Identification Teams. I was the inaugural President of the Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law (Tasmanian Branch) and I am a current member of the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences. I previously worked as a provisionally registered Psychologist in the Department of Justice in Western Australian, working on prisoner release reviews for the Parole Board, developing and evaluating prison-based group programs for men and women offenders and delivering individual treatment programs for the Offender Programs Branch.I have completed two research fellowships: An ARC Postdoctoral fellowship at UTAS, and an NHMRC Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Western Australia.",psychology<weight>100%<bk>curriculum<weight>77%<bk>worldview<weight>36%<bk>audit<weight>35%<bk>social

I come from one corner of Africa, and in that part of the world, we have no ""sir names/family names"", each person is known by their given names. So, formally or informally, with or without a title, my name is Yohannes (son of) Kinfu.I am a statistical demographer and economist by training. In a career spanning over 15 years of post-doctoral experience, I had a unique opportunity of engagement in various institutional settings across five regions (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Middle East) of the world. In Australia, I have worked as a Senior Research Fellow at the School of Population Health at the University of Queensland (UQ) and before that had served as a Statistician and officer in charge of the Annual World Health Statistics Report at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. And before that, I was a Research Fellow at the Australian National University (ANU). I have also worked as an Associate Professor of Population Medicine at Qatar University, and served as Head of the Urbanization and Wellbeing Research Program and Leader of the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (NUHDSS) at the African Population and Health Research Centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Currently, I am an Associate Professor of Global Health and Health Economics at the Faculty of Health, University of Canberra (Australia). I also hold positions at the Department of Health Metrics Sciences, University of Washington, and Morduch Children Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia.My research interests are in health care economics, health system performance evaluation, and in statistical and mathematical modelling of disease patterns, risk factors, and population dynamics in a global context. I have examined and supervised PhD students and taught graduate and undergraduate courses in Ethiopia, Ghana, Germany, Qatar, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia. I have attracted over $4 million from various sources for my research, including from the ARC, the Australian Heart Foundation, and the Gates Foundation. My work has been published widely in major medical and public health journals. In 2020, I was listed among Australia s 66 leading researchers in the Health and Medicine discipline and named Australia s Research Leader in my field.

As an infantry officer the focus of his career was with soldiers in command, training and staff appointments. He was fortunate enough to command at almost every level in the Army and to serve on exchange in Hong Kong with the Gurkhas and in the United States at the Army s Command and General Staff College.Peter concluded his career in the Army with the rank of Lieutenant General in the appointment of the Chief of Army. He served in this appointment for 6 years, which was the longest period of service as Chief since General Harry Chauvel in the 1920s. His period of command was marked by the continuous global deployment of Australian soldiers on high tempo, complex and demanding combat operations. During his tenure as Chief of Army he was responsible for the rapid expansion and development of the Army to enable it to cope with the many changing demands of modern conflict. His focus was to enlarge the Army and provide a hardened and networked force with increased adaptability and flexibility.Since leaving the Army Peter has joined the University of Canberra as a Professor and the foundation Director of the National Security Institute. He is a member of the Australian Institute of Company Directors and has been appointed to the Boards of Codan Limited and Electro Optic Systems Holdings Limited.

His research predominantly falls into two areas. One is political leadership, which examines success and failure for various political leaders, in various historical and institutional situations. This research also examines the role of political rhetoric in defining public policy to commentators and the public, and in attempting to create positive assessments of policies. The second major focus of Brendan s research is political participation, which examines the role of Government in encouraging citizens to engage in political and policy decisions. Brendan has published in various Australian and international politics journals.Since January 2015, Brendan has been IGPA s Education Program Convener. This role has required a significant amount of coordination and interaction with teachers and students, primarily in managing IGPA s various Graduate Certificate Programs.

61586ed0d7b0c43ebd7552dd,Education,null,Katharine Mckinnon,"Katharine is a human geographer whose work engages with community economies, gender, development and care. For the past 20 years she has worked with a broad range of communities in Australia and the Asia-Pacific, engaging in qualitative and participatory social research for community learning and development.Katharine s research is driven by a curiosity about how our human communities structure efforts to act upon the world, and, in particular, to transform it for the better. Efforts to better the world take place in many different contexts and the professionalisation of these efforts is well established in the fields of community development, social enterprise, agronomy, health and education. Her current research considers questions of: how to achieve gender equity in ways that suit the lives and livelihoods of people in their different places and communities; how to reshape enterprises and organisations around priorities of care and inclusivity; and how to put an ethics of care for people and environment at the heart of economies and livelihoods.Katharine has published extensively on topics of community learning and development, and economies of care. Her most recent book, Birthing Work: The Collective Labour of Childbirth highlights the human and more-than-human interdependence that is at the foundation of family life and livelihood. Her work on community development practice in northern Thailand is published as a monograph in Development Professionals in Northern Thailand: Hope, Politics and Practice (2012). She has contributed to several key texts in her field, including The Handbook of Diverse Economies, Postdevelopment in Practice, Sage Handbook of Human Geography and the Blackwell A Companion to Social Geography. Her work has also been published in leading journals in the discipline, including the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Social and Cultural Geography, Area and

61586f7bd7b0c43ebd7552e3,Institute for Governance & Policy Analysis,null,Riyana Miranti,"Riyana (Mira) Miranti joined University of Canberra in October 2007. As a socio-economist and development economist, she has a strong research interest in the research areas related to social wellbeing and equity particularly focusing on the issues of disadvantage and wellbeing including poverty, social exclusion and inequality affecting children, youth, older people and other groups of population. Mira has two countries of specialisation, Australia and Indonesia.Mira has continuously worked extensively in the area of economic development for Southeast Asia, particularly for Indonesia. She pioneered the Indonesian related research activities at NATSEM/IGPA. Mira is currently a Convenor of Indonesian Program at the Faculty of Business, Government and Law. She is also a Research Coordinator for IGPA and Canberra School of Politics, Economics and Society. Prior to her PhD, she worked as a Research Associate at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore. Mira has also led many applied commissioned research projects on Indonesian economic development issues for various international agencies including the USAID, UNESCO, OECD and the ADB, particularly in the areas of poverty, inequality and social protection for children. The OECD report on  Trends in Poverty and Inequality in Decentralising Indonesia , that she led, has been cited widely.Mira has been working extensively under several Australian Research Council (ARC) grants which focus on children and youth wellbeing at the spatial level, including the ARC Discovery - Opportunity and Disadvantage: Differences in wellbeing among Australian Adults and ARC Discovery - Children and Child and Youth Social Exclusion in Australia at a small area level which explore the multidimensional measures of wellbeing. She has been one of the key researchers who developed the Child and Youth Social Exclusion Index at a small area level in Australia. Both Child and Youth Social Exclusion Indices have been used by policy makers such as the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS), the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) and also by service providers such as the Red Cross and ACOSS.Mira has led many research projects in the area of wellbeing of older adults including developing a new conceptual framework to understand well-being of older adults taking into account location and mobility. This work has been extended to estimate the prevalence of social exclusion of older adults in Australia. Recently, Mira was the co-author of an AMP.NATSEM Income and Wealth Report entitled  Going the distance: working longer, living healthier  which examines the relationship between health and working in later life and was co-author of two other reports in this field namely:  Small area Indicators of Wellbeing for Older Australians (IWOA) , a report for the Benevolent Society and  Index of Educational Advantage (IdEA) , a report for the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training. Mira was also the Chief Investigator representing the UC team for the ARC Linkage (LP120100624) –  Understanding and preventing workforce vulnerabilities in mid-life and beyond

Dr Naumovski s continued his studies by gaining a PhD in Food Science where he investigated the cholesterol lowering properties of major green tea catechin, epigallocatehin gallate (EGCG) in animal models of hypercholesterolemia as well as determining the pharmacokinetic and cholesterol lowering properties of EGCG in humans. During this time, Dr Naumovski applied his expertise in the development of functional food products and adaptation of chromatographic methods used for the analysis systemic absorption of EGCG and determination of cardiovascular disease biomarkers (sterols, blood lipids, carotenoids and tocopherols).Dr Naumovski commenced his employment at University of Canberra (UC) in 2014 where he has established a research arm investigating healthy aging trajectories, plant bioactives, psychocardiology and development of nutraceuticals. He is the member of the Future of Food in the Canberra Region group and core member of the Faculty of Health Area of Strength Ageing Research Group. Dr Naumovski is a team leader of the Functional Foods and Nutrition Research (FFNR) Laboratory and one of the Chief Investigators of the Nutrition and Healthy Ageing Trajectories in Retirement Living (NutriHAT-RL) study. He holds positions of Visiting Professor (Harokopio University, Athens, Greece), Conjoint Senior Lecturer (University of Newcastle, Australia) and Honorary Fellow (Abertay University, UK). He also leads a self-assessment team working on the improvement in gender equality in the STEMM sector as a part of the national program Science in Australia Gender Equity (SAGE).Dr Naumovski has

61587306d7b0c43ebd755301,Nursing,null,Holly Louise Northam,"Dr Northam brings over 30 years of clinical experience to her research and teaching practice. Holly has a strong social justice focus that is underpinned by her professional identity as a nurse and midwife. Her PhD study,  Hope for a peaceful death and organ donation  identified that more must be done to alleviate suffering caused by communication failures in healthcare. Holly played an instrumental role in setting up and running the ACT Organ and Tissue Donation Service and has been recognised for her expertise in this specialisation.Holly s research and teaching approaches are framed using the lens of hope and restorative practice to identify and support vulnerable people in health settings. The University of Canberra Collaborative Indigenous Research Initiative have provided more that $100,000 in grant money to support the work of a team of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers (guided by Aboriginal Elders with Holly as CI) to identify restorative practices in healthcare to close the gap on inequitable Indigneous healthcare outcomes. The work of this team is centred on the University of Canberra Hospital and Whanganui Hospital in New Zealand. The work explores the idea that culture leads practice, and by privleging vulnerable voices it is possible to improve healthcare outcomes including performance measures such as clinical indicators, patient and staff satisfaction, staff retention and the budget  bottom line . Authentic voice of the most vulnerable voice in health care systems clearly heard throughout those systems are seen as pivotal to improved outcomes.This work also informs acardiac rehabiitation program provided for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women as a research project seeking to create a culturally safe program in an out of hospital environment.In a related area of consumer vulnerability, bereaved families of organ donors are working with a team of academic leaders led by Holly to explore a closed online community of donor s and recipients, and the impacts of their relationships. This work will be publically shared by the consumers in a first of its kind conference scheduled at UC for October the 4th and 5th this year hosted by Donor Families Australia.Other research work that she is currently engaged in includes working with Elders and using Yarning Circles as a restorative practice in teaching health students about contemporary issues related to Indigenous healthcare.Several other projects relating to end of life care, critical care nursing practices and neuro intensive care are also underway in Holly s research portfolio. Holly works with healthcare consumers, vulnerable communities, professionals and academics that are alert to recognising and responding to healthcare inequity. Holly is honoured to work with the ACT Restorative Practice Community, part of an International Learning Community of Restorative Practice. Holly is an active advocate working in leadership roles on several NGOs that seek to address healthcare inequity and elevate the voices of vulnerable people.Areas of TeachingHolly is passionate about ensuring that healthcare professionals are supported by excellence in education to enable a flourishing community.HDR Completions:Dr Jane Frost (2017).

615873e6d7b0c43ebd755307,Arts & Communication,mailto:Mathieu.O neil@canberra.edu.au,Mathieu O Neil,"Mathieu is Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Canberra s News & Media Research Centre, where he leads the Critical Conversations Lab. Mathieu s research focuses on the affordances of commons-based peer production such as free and open source software and Wikipedia. He is currently investigating how Wikipedia can assist in generating civic online reasoning and best fact-checking practice in three ACT schools (Co-developing a new approach to media literacy in the attention economy, ACT Education Directorate-UC, Affiliated Schools Research Program, 2021-2022). He also leads an international team researching the organisational and public policy implications of the co-production of free and open source software (Mapping the co-production of digital infrastructure by peer projects and firms, Sloan and Ford Foundations, Critical Digital Infrastructure Fund, 2019-2020). Mathieu has played a key role in developing the field of peer production studies by founding and editing the peer-reviewed Journal of Peer Production (2011-2021), by editing the Handbook of Peer Production (Wiley-Blackwell Handbooks in Communication and Media, 2021), and by founding an international think tank, the Digital Commons Policy Council, in 2021.Mathieu has also made significant contributions to the development of innovative online research methods and concepts, most recently thanks to an international project in which he is developing heuristics to detect online echo chambers (Bots Building Bridges (3B): Theoretical, Empirical, and Technological Foundations for Systems that Monitor and Support Political Deliberation Online, Volkswagen Foundation, Artificial Intelligence and the Society of the Future, 2021-2024). Mathieu is a founding member of the Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks (VOSON), a world leader in web science and big data analytics located in the Australian National University, where Mathieu is Honorary Associate Professor of Sociology. Mathieu s research on the adoption of innovation and the diffusion of health misinformation in the online environment brings together analytical frameworks such as social network analysis, actor-network theory and the sociologies of fields and controversies. The quality of this work was recognised when Mathieu and his co-author Robert Ackland were awarded the 2012 Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology (CITAMS) section of the American Sociological Association Paper Award, which recognises an  outstanding published paper or book chapter related to the sociology of communications or the sociology of information technology.  Mathieu and Rob are the sole recipients of the CITAMS Paper Award outside North America.Mathieu s research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals such as Social Networks, Information, Communication & Society, Réseaux, New Media and Society, the International Journal of Communication, and Organization Studies, amongst others. He previously held academic appointments at the Université Stendhal - Grenoble 3, the Australian National University and the Université Paris Sorbonne. He has also worked as a magazine editor and exhibition curator in Singapore, and as a researcher for the Australian Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.",firm<weight>69%<bk>infrastructure<weight>90%<bk>labor<weight>55%<bk>Western world<weight>23%<bk>exploitation<weight>45%<bk>social change<weight>100%<bk>capitalist

He is known internationally for his work in medicalisation and mental health, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and public policy, and the influence of minority parliaments on governance and policy administration.Brenton s diverse academic and professional experience equips him to create research with real-world impact, genuinely collaborate in research implementation and translate findings for non-academic audiences. He specialises in co-design and coproduction of bespoke social modelling and evaluation methodologies that incorporate the policy, practice and place-based expertise of professionals working in complex social contexts.His academic work was the first to identify a link between low SES and greater medication use for ADHD in Australia. He also conducted the first study of the experiences of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD looking at the impact on identity and access to supports. Brenton was also one of a team of UK-based academics who ran the first English citizen s assemblies on the devolution of powers from Westminster.His professional experience includes time as Director (Public Policy) with Nous Group consultants and Director (Research) with Catholic Social Services Australia. In these roles, he built a strong practical knowledge of the health and social service sectors.

In this role, he supported the handling of all legislation before federal parliament and worked directly with senior and shadow ministers and their staff. Based on these experiences, he has published a guide on shaping policy within minority government contexts. Together, this experience underpins his passion for teaching and degree supervision with pre-service and in-service policy leaders.Brenton s previous academic roles include Senior Research Fellow in a UK Russell Group impact centre where he worked with officers in Westminster to improve the impact of academic research on policy. He has also held Senior Lecturer positions in sociology and teacher education. As part of this, he co-led an Australian Research Council linkage project to support community capacity building and place-based responses through schools in some of Australia s poorest communities.Recognition of Brenton s service to the community extends back to 1997 when he was the Young South Australian of the Year and was a finalist in the Young Australian of the Year awards.Brenton has published over 60 peer reviewed publications and presented across 4 continents. He has had over 90,000 people read his contributions to the research translation site, the Conversation, while his handbook on ADHD sold over 6,000 copies internationally.He is currently an honorary

615877a1d7b0c43ebd75532a,Design & Built Environment,null,Julian Raxworthy,"Julian Raxworthy is Associate Professor and Discipline Lead: landscape architecture in the Faculty of Art and Design at the University of Canberra. Initially working as a gardener & landscaper, he trained as a horticulturalist at Ryde TAFE, later becoming a landscape architect, graduating with his undergraduate degree (with honours) and research master s degree (by design) in landscape architecture, both from RMIT, Australia. He has a PhD from the University of Queensland, where he is an Honorary Associate Professor with the ATCH (Architecture, Theory, Criticism and History) Research Centre.As a registered landscape architect in Australia, Julian worked extensively with Aspect Studios, both in Melbourne where he helped develop the practice as Design Manager, and in Sydney, where he co-founded their internationally recognised Sydney Studio. Later, he worked as Principal Landscape Architect for award-winning architecture practices such as Donovan Hill in Brisbane (now part of Bligh Voller Neild), and most recently for Wolff Architects, in Cape Town, South Africa where he is also a registered landscape architect.Prior to joining the University of Canberra, he was tenured faculty at RMIT University, Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane and at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, where he has taught into landscape architecture, urban design and architecture programs. He was also steering committee member for the M.Phil (Southern Urbanism) for the African Centre for Cities (ACC).He has presented key note lectures at the IVEuropean Biennial of Landscape Architecture in Barcelona, LOCUS ISTE in Denmark and EASY GOING, at the Academie van Bouwkunst, Amsterdam. He has also taught internationally, notably at the University of Virginia, where he organised a Myles H.Thaler symposium and was visiting professor, but also as a guest at universities in Europe, including three times at the École Nationale Supérieure de Paysage(ENSP) Versailles, where he was recently Visiting Professor in 2019 & 2020. In 2020, he was part of the Sylvester Baxter Lecture at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design entitled  Plants in the Design Imagination .A co-founder ofKerb, the student landscape architecture journal from RMIT (now in its 26thedition), he writes regularly about contemporary landscape projects, in Australia forLandscape Architecture Australia,Monument,Architecture AustraliaandArchitectural Review Australia, and internationally inTopos, SCAPEandLAM. In 2004, he co-editedThe MESH Book: Landscape & Infrastructure,published by RMIT Press, and in 2011 Sun publishers in Amsterdam publishedSunburnt: Landscape Architecture in Australia, which he co-authored. His most recent book isOvergrown: practices between landscape architecture and gardening,which was published in 2018 by The MIT Press, and was supported by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. He has lectured widely on the book, first in 2018 on the east coast USA at Harvard GSD, the University of Pennsylvania, Penn State, Cornell University, as well as at the Graham Foundation in Chicago, and in 2019 on the west coast USA at University of Southern California, Cal Poly San Louis Obispo and at the University of Oregon, and also in Australia, at the University of Queensland, University of Adelaide, University of Technology Sydney, and as a keynote at the 2019 Festival of Landscape Architecture in Melbourne.

61587976d7b0c43ebd755335,Science,null,Matt Rutar,"Matt Rutar obtained his PhD in Biomedical Science from the Australian National University in 2011, at the Research School of Biology. Following the completion of his PhD, Matt took up a postdoctoral position at the John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR) to further pursue his interest in vision sciences, particularly retinal degenerative diseases. After several fruitful years at JCSMR, including leading an independently funded research team with grants from the Ophthalmic Research Institute of Australia and Retina Australia, Matt relocated to the University of Melbourne in 2016 to continue his study of ocular disorders. During this time, he established his own laboratory in the department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, supported by Project Grant funding from the NHMRC. Matt moved his laboratory to the University of Canberra, after accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty of Science and Technology in 2021. The major goal of Matt s research is to understand the molecular and cellular factors that underscore vision-threatening retinal diseases. Presently, this work focuses on the immunological landscape of the eye, and the environmental and neurodegenerative indicators that orchestrate inflammation in the retina. Chronic inflammatory processes have recently emerged as an important factor underlying the pathogenesis of many retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and accounts for ~50% of all cases of irreversible vision loss in Australia, and has few available treatments. Ultimately, Matt s work aims to uncover new processes of immune regulation in the retina, while simultaneously harnessing this knowledge to develop more effective therapies for retinopathies including AMD.",Macrophages<weight>80%<bk>Atlases<weight>65%<bk>Myeloid Cells<weight>61%<bk>Stem cells<weight>42%<bk>Phenotype<weight>51%<bk>Retina<weight>100%<bk>Knockout Mice<weight>47%<bk>Phagocytosis<weight>37%<bk>Macular Degeneration<weight>26%<bk>Gene Knockdown Techniques<weight>100%<bk>Transfection<weight>65%<bk>Nucleic Acids<weight>50%<bk>Lipids<weight>49%<bk>diabetic retinopathy<weight>100%<bk>environmental models<weight>91%<bk>retinal diseases<weight>100%<bk>macular degeneration<weight>89%<bk>glaucoma<weight>83%<bk>Purinergic P2X7 Receptors<weight>100%<bk>Retinal Diseases<weight>24%<bk>Glaucoma<weight>43%<bk>Ocular Vision<weight>39%<bk>Pluripotent Stem Cells<weight>100%<bk>In Vitro Techniques<weight>13%<bk>Macrophage Activation<weight>12%<bk>Adaptive Immunity<weight>100%<bk>Innate Immunity<weight>90%<bk>Inflammation<weight>26%<bk>Leukocytes<weight>57%<bk>Gene Regulatory Networks<weight>53%<bk>Vertebrate Photoreceptor Cells<weight>100%<bk>MicroRNAs<weight>70%<bk>Retinal Degeneration<weight>100%<bk>Complement Activation<weight>92%<bk>Oxidative Stress<weight>22%<bk>Obesity<weight>61%<bk>Glutathione Transferase<weight>100%<bk>Complement C1q<weight>100%<bk>Microglia<weight>83%<bk>Interleukin-1<weight>80%<bk>Chemokines<weight>100%<bk>Complement C3<weight>62%<bk>Inbred C57BL Mouse<weight>88%<bk>Light<weight>81%<bk>Cell death<weight>100%<bk>photoreceptors<weight>84%<bk>death<weight>76%<bk>therapy<weight>64%<bk>damage<weight>47%<bk>Animals<weight>28%<bk>Chemical activation<weight>72%<bk>cyclo(cysteinyl-glutaminyl-isoleucyl-tryptophyl-lysyl-glutaminyl-lysyl-prolyl-aspartyl-leucyl-cysteinyl-amide)<weight>100%<bk>Photoreceptor Cells<weight>25%<bk>Pyruvic Acid<weight>84%<bk>Cell Death<weight>15%<bk>Retinal Pigment Epithelium<weight>100%<bk>Retinoschisis<weight>30%<bk>Eye Manifestations<weight>25%<bk>retinal degeneration<weight>92%<bk>Polarization<weight>54%<bk>macrophages<weight>53%<bk>neuroglia<weight>55%<bk>monocytes<weight>52%<bk>Hyperoxia<weight>60%<bk>Oxygen<weight>48%<bk>premature birth<weight>94%<bk>Retinopathy of Prematurity<weight>84%<bk>4-hydroxy-2-nonenal<weight>21%<bk>Small Interfering RNA<weight>68%<bk>Gene Expression<weight>29%<bk>Monocytes<weight>87%<bk>In Situ Hybridization<weight>32%<bk>Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein<weight>51%<bk>In Situ Nick-End Labeling<weight>49%,Assistant Professor,Canberra,Retina<weight>100%<bk>Retinal Degeneration<weight>96%<bk>Light<weight>53%<bk>Macrophages<weight>50%<bk>Macular Degeneration<weight>49%<bk>Microglia<weight>49%<bk>Inflammation<weight>32%<bk>Chemokines<weight>32%<bk>Complement Activation<weight>27%<bk>Complement C3<weight>21%<bk>MicroRNAs<weight>16%<bk>Retinal Diseases<weight>16%<bk>Monocytes<weight>15%<bk>Photoreceptor Cells<weight>15%<bk>Cell Death<weight>15%<bk>Oxidative Stress<weight>14%<bk>In Situ Hybridization<weight>12%<bk>Hyperoxia<weight>12%<bk>Leukocytes<weight>11%<bk>Pluripotent Stem Cells<weight>10%<bk>Immunohistochemistry<weight>10%<bk>Oxygen<weight>9%<bk>Fludrocortisone<weight>9%<bk>Small Interfering RNA<weight>9%<bk>Complement C1q<weight>9%<bk>Vertebrate Photoreceptor Cells<weight>8%<bk>Blood-Retinal Barrier<weight>8%<bk>Purinergic P2X7 Receptors<weight>8%<bk>Interleukin-1<weight>8%<bk>Gene Knockdown Techniques<weight>8%<bk>Triamcinolone Acetonide<weight>8%<bk>Retinopathy of Prematurity<weight>7%<bk>Phenotype<weight>7%<bk>Retinal Pigment Epithelium<weight>7%<bk>Electroretinography<weight>6%<bk>Atlases<weight>6%<bk>Pyruvic Acid<weight>6%<bk>Glutathione Transferase<weight>6%<bk>Myeloid Cells<weight>6%<bk>Adaptive Immunity<weight>6%<bk>Innate Immunity<weight>5%<bk>Anti-Inflammatory Agents<weight>5%<bk>Genes<weight>5%<bk>Transfection<weight>5%<bk>Therapeutics<weight>5%<bk>Gene Expression<weight>5%<bk>Life Style<weight>5%,,UC_61587976d7b0c43ebd755335

61587afad7b0c43ebd755345,Centre for Change Governance,mailto:Jacki.Schirmer@canberra.edu.au,Jacki Schirmer,"Associate Professor Schirmer leads the Regional Wellbeing Survey, an annual survey examining the views of 13,000 rural and regional Australians about the liveability and resilience of their community, and their own wellbeing and resilience. It covers topics ranging from understanding how to support carers living in the bush, to identifying the impacts of poor internet connectivity, and understanding how events such as droughts, floods and environmental policy change affect rural communities. In addition to leading the Regional Wellbeing Survey, Jacki s personal research interests focus on understanding the social dimensions of natural resource management, particularly how people s access to and use of natural resources affects their health and wellbeing. Her work in recent years has focused on (i) analysing the social impacts of changes in management of natural resources such as forests, fisheries and water on workers and rural communities, (ii) understanding the factors that drive conflict over natural resource management and which affect social acceptability of environmental policy and practice, and (iii) understanding how to achieve greater adoption of pro-environmental behaviours.",Agriculture<weight>100%<bk>sustainable agriculture<weight>95%<bk>farming system<weight>93%<bk>farming

61587ca2d7b0c43ebd755359,Centre for Change Governance,mailto:Gerry.Stoker@canberra.edu.au,Gerry Stoker,"Professor Gerry Stoker is Professor of Politics and Governance at the University of Southampton, UK and has recently joined ANZSIG as a Centenary Professor. He held previous professorial posts at Manchester and Strathclyde. Professor Stoker s main research interests are in governance, democratic politics, local and regional governance, urban politics, public participation and public service reform. He has authored or edited over 20 books and published over 70 refereed articles or chapters in books. Professor Stoker was the founding Chair of the New Local Government Network which won the UK think tank of the year in 2004 and his most recent book  Why Politics Matters  won the 2006 political book of the year award from the Political Studies Association of the UK. Professor Stoker has provided advice to various parts of the UK government and is also an expert advisor to the Council of Europe on local government and participation issues. In 2004, he won the Political Studies Association Award for  making a difference  in recognition of the impact of his work on governance issues.It was in the area of urban politics and local government studies that Professor Stoker first made his name and continues to be seen as a leading authority. He has been a prolific publisher in this area notably The Politics of Local Government, Local Government in Europe, Theories of Urban Politics and Rethinking Local Democracy. For five years (1992-7) Professor Stoker was Programme Director of a £2m research endeavour run for the UK s Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC) under the title of the Local Governance Programme. Two edited books captured the main output of the programme The New Management of Local Governance and The New Politics of Local Governance. A single authored book Transforming Local Governance on the reforms undertaken by New Labour was published in early 2004 and later that year an edited book on British Local Government into the 21st Century emerged that analyzed New Labour s reform in more detail. From April 2002 Professor Stoker has been heading up the major Government funded five-year evaluation of the new constitutional and standard arrangements introduced into local government in the UK by the 2000 Local Government Act (see www.elgnce.org.uk for research reports and publications). In more normative vein he has been a strong advocate of a new localism and a greater devolution in the approach to governance both in the UK and beyond.A further theme of Professor Stoker s work has been his interest with citizen participation, social capital and civil renewal. This work led to the development of a heuristic to help public authorities investigate their public participation strategies and identify how they might be improved. The Council of Europe has adopted this CLEAR framework and used it in a range of municipal settings throughout Europe. More recently, Gerry s focus has been on understanding the changing nature of citizen participation in a range of country settings including Australia. Indeed, he will help meet the Institute s aim of designing and analysing unique data sets on the qualities of Australian democracy and (where appropriate) processes of democratisation internationally.",governance system<weight>100%<bk>Multi-level Governance<weight>87%<bk>Governance<weight>64%<bk>governance arrangement<weight>51%<bk>multi-level-governance<weight>51%<bk>good

The research conducted by him covers areas such as spatial housing disadvantage, economic disadvantage (poverty), income inequality and wellbeing. His principal areas of research are spatial disadvantage and wellbeing; spatial statistics and small area estimation; and community wellbeing.Robert also leads work using a spatial microsimulation technique to derive small area estimates of many indicators of disadvantage and wellbeing. So far, this technique has been used to derive small area estimates of poverty and housing stress; and small area estimates of subjective wellbeing and indigenous disadvantage.Robert has published extensively in the academic literature on spatial disadvantage and social exclusion, and has presented results of his work to a number of national and international conferences. He has also presented results from his research on spatial housing stress to the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability. He has been a Chief Investigator on a number of Australian Research Council grants, and has conducted commissioned work for a number of agencies including the Tasmanian Social Inclusion Unit; the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations; the AMP; Commonwealth Bank; and Veda.Robert is involved in the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN), and is on the

Thompson is the CEO of the New South Wales Institute of Sport (NSWIS) based at Sydney Olympic Park. From 2013-2017, he was the Inaugural Director of the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise.  Prior to that he held a number of senior positions in high performance sport, namely National Director of Sport Sciences and Regional Director (North) at the English Institute of Sport (2002-2009) and Manager of Coaching, Sports Science and Sports Medicine at the Welsh Institute of Sport (1999-2002). Professor Thompson has published over 200 articles relating to the field of sport science and has presented at numerous national and international conferences. From 2009-2017, he has attracted significant grant and consultancy funding (>$5M). Professor Thompson was awarded Fellowship of the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences in 2009 and Fellowship of the American College of Sports Medicine in 2013. He has been a Section Editor of the European Journal of Sport Sciences and an Associate Editor and Advisory Board Member of the International Journal of Sport Physiology and Performance.Professor Thompson has contributed to committees and working parties in the UK which developed the National Coaching Certificate and helped to establish a career path for Sport Physicians in the UK. He has also contributed to the development and design of a number of major sport facilities including: Wales National 50-m Swimming Pool, Swansea (opened 2002), English Institute of Sport Regional Performance Centre, Gateshead (opened Mar 2006), Sunderland (UK) 50-m swimming pool (opened March 2007), Northumbria University Sport Central building (2010). Most recently, he has been part of the design and project management team bringing the University of Canberra Sport Commons to fruition (opened in 2014) which includes the Brumbies super 15 rugby club as well as state-of-the-art education and research facilities.Professor Thompson has been a strong advocate of the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences (BASES) acting as a Chair of the Sport and Performance Division and Special Sports Science Committee.

61588085d7b0c43ebd755377,Centre for Creative & Cultural Research,mailto:Bethaney.Turner@canberra.edu.au,Bethaney Turner,"My research explores the multispecies relationships between people, place and the environment (more-than-human) concentrating on how best to build the resilience and capacity of communities to enact more sustainable futures in a time of climate change. I have particular expertise in local food systems (including community food production, food rescue and food waste management) and understanding the impacts of everyday food interactions on human and planetary health and wellbeing. Conceptions of waste and practices of reuse and repair through community sharing projects are also current areas of focus.I use participatory, ethnographic and non-representational methodologies to conduct fieldwork informed by an attentiveness to the more-than-human. This fieldwork is informed by policy analysis and interdisciplinary theoretical approaches drawing on my background in social movement studies, cultural theory, critical food studies, environmental humanities and cultural geography. My work is underpinned by an interest in: the materialities of everyday lived experience at the nature-culture interface (or nature-culture entanglements); how these experiences are represented; and generative conceptual and applied possibilities that build on current community practices and imaginaries. My research is embedded in local, community action while being directly connected to broader global socio-environmental issues.I have over a decade of research experience with local governments, schools, community groups, cultural institutions and other industry in designing interventions, gathering and evaluating data, and communicating outcomes that have direct impact on policy and practice.I am employed as an Associate Professor in the University of Canberra s Centre for Creative and Cultural Research within the Faculty of Arts and Design. As the Faculty s Director of Higher Degrees by Research I am privileged to be able to support the development of our Faculty s diverse HDR cohort and I consistently draw inspiration from their

61588149d7b0c43ebd75537c,Health Research Institute,mailto:Penney.Upton@canberra.edu.au,Penney Upton,"Dr. Upton is an experienced research psychologist whose work focuses on the improvement of health and healthcare services. Her research interests include health behaviours, patient reported outcomes, the implementation of evidence based practice and health service evaluation. She has led projects related to quality of life and wellbeing in chronic illness and long-term conditions, family weight management and children s eating behaviours, alcohol and tobacco use in adulthood, and the training and support of newly qualified health professionals to apply evidence based practice. Study findings have resulted in changes to policy and strategy both locally and nationally in the UK.Dr Upton has published widely on topics related to health and wellbeing across the lifespan including the impact of chronic illness on children s quality of life, approaches to changing risky health behaviours such as smoking in adulthood, and the use of touchscreen technology to enhance the wellbeing of older adults with dementia. She is also committed to the development of clinical and teaching practice which is evidence-based and is co-author of the evidence-based practice questionnaire (EBPQ) and the student evidence-based questionnaire (SEBPQ) whcih measure knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of evidence based practice, and which have had an impact internationally in both clinical and educational settings.","Agriculture<weight>100%<bk>sustainable agriculture<weight>95%<bk>farming system<weight>93%<bk>farming

Autism spectrum disorder, predominantly broader autism phenotypes, and perceptual/cognitive functioning (like action understanding). Link between attention and consciousness perception. Noisy brains, and their influence on perception and performance. Visual illusions.Jeroen J.A. van Boxtel started with a master s degrees in Biology (Utrecht University) and Cognitive Sciences (Université Pierre et Marie Curie & Collège de France, France), after which he completed his PhD at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, at the cross-disciplinary Helmholtz Institute in 2008. After obtaining his PhD, he moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he worked for two years on the relationship between attention and consciousness with Prof. Christof Koch. In 2010, he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles, to work on questions related to human action perception and attention, and the link to Autism Spectrum Disorders. In 2013, Jeroen van Boxtel was recruited to Monash University where he also headed the Cognitive Neuroimaging group at Monash Biomedical Imaging. He currently works at the School of Psychology at the University of Canberra, and focuses on the negative effects of attention, the link between attention and conscious perception, the influence of attention on biological motion perception, and the influence of noise on visual processing.",psychology<weight>100%<bk>curriculum<weight>77%<bk>worldview<weight>36%<bk>audit<weight>35%<bk>social

6158819fd7b0c43ebd755382,Canberra Business School,null,Barbara Voss,"My principal research concern is equity within the politics of businesses. My research discusses the inter-related aspects of accounting, politics, regulation and discourses. My work is multidisciplinary and involves how discourses are used, interpreted and applied by business. Traditionally, with respect environmental, social and inclusion discourses, businesses tend to treat these issues as a form of  return on investment  for business to engage with these discourses, they do so, but the nature of the engagement is subject to challenge. My research investigates the politics of businesses within public and private sector contexts at methodological, technical and political levels. My research is informed by post-structural theory, including Laclau and Mouffe, Gramsci, Derrida, Butler, Baudrillard, Foucault, Žižek and I have a strong interest in feminist and post-colonial theories.My current work is divided into three projects: a) corporate social responsibility and sustainability – involving a deeper understanding of the meanings of sustainability and the politics of sustainability for business and its appropriation of knowledge. In some extent, this project expands the implications of the technologies of governance and discusses issues such as corruption, fraud, political campaigns and marketing with a special focus on Brazil; b) financial accounting and regulation – including discussing the influence of neoliberal and post-colonial policies on financial accounting standards, regulation of auditing and the impacts on businesses and societies; c) diversity – including understanding initiatives and politics concerning diversity in the corporate space, including issues of sexuality, gender, identity and intersectionality. All projects endeavour to uncover the role of accounting through multi-spheres and multi-voices.",firm<weight>100%<bk>inclusion<weight>88%<bk>staff<weight>77%<bk>successor generation<weight>67%<bk>intersectionality<weight>48%<bk>Auditing<weight>100%<bk>Audit<weight>87%<bk>Public Interest<weight>40%<bk>corporate social responsibility<weight>100%<bk>corruption<weight>58%<bk>Brazil<weight>29%<bk>best practice<weight>22%<bk>federal police<weight>22%<bk>Internal audits<weight>100%<bk>Federal Government<weight>55%<bk>Independent Commission Against Corruption<weight>38%<bk>surveillance<weight>18%<bk>Accounting Profession<weight>100%<bk>Employee Perceptions<weight>88%<bk>Inclusion<weight>73%<bk>Staff<weight>71%<bk>Attrition<weight>39%<bk>environmental accounting<weight>100%<bk>Social Accounting<weight>86%<bk>Environmental Accounting<weight>83%<bk>politics<weight>73%<bk>Economic Growth<weight>19%<bk>Ideologies<weight>100%<bk>expropriation<weight>72%<bk>shareholder-wealth maximization<weight>54%<bk>ideology<weight>43%<bk>state owned company<weight>42%<bk>Corporate Accountability<weight>100%<bk>Tanzania<weight>84%<bk>Human Rights<weight>62%<bk>Disclosure<weight>56%<bk>Foreign Investment<weight>50%<bk>Solid Waste<weight>98%<bk>Environmental Disclosure<weight>82%<bk>Public Company<weight>35%<bk>Environmental Information<weight>26%<bk>agribusiness<weight>100%<bk>Environmental Impact<weight>98%<bk>solid wastes<weight>94%<bk>Agribusiness<weight>82%,Assistant Professor,Canberra,Solid Waste<weight>100%<bk>Environmental Disclosure<weight>73%<bk>Disclosure<weight>61%<bk>Corporate Accountability<weight>53%<bk>Social Accounting<weight>50%<bk>Environmental Impact<weight>50%<bk>Environmental Accounting<weight>49%<bk>Tanzania<weight>45%<bk>Accounting Profession<weight>44%<bk>Agribusiness<weight>42%<bk>Employee Perceptions<weight>39%<bk>Gas<weight>35%<bk>Auditing<weight>35%<bk>Human Rights<weight>33%<bk>Inclusion<weight>32%<bk>Staff<weight>32%<bk>Audit<weight>30%<bk>Brazil<weight>21%<bk>Environmental Information<weight>28%<bk>Foreign Investment<weight>27%<bk>Sustainability Reports<weight>22%<bk>Financial Returns<weight>21%<bk>Environmental Liability<weight>18%<bk>Return on Investment<weight>17%<bk>Attrition<weight>17%<bk>Public Company<weight>17%<bk>Co2<weight>14%<bk>Public Interest<weight>14%<bk>Qualitative Study<weight>12%<bk>Financial Variables<weight>12%<bk>Economic Growth<weight>11%<bk>Developing Countries<weight>11%<bk>Financial Statements<weight>11%<bk>Liability<weight>10%<bk>Sustainable Development<weight>9%<bk>Power Relations<weight>9%<bk>Emerging Economies<weight>9%<bk>Agenda<weight>9%<bk>Discourse Theory<weight>8%<bk>Accounting Firms<weight>8%<bk>Discourse Analysis<weight>8%<bk>Interpretive<weight>8%<bk>Marriage<weight>8%<bk>Marginalization<weight>7%<bk>Visibility<weight>7%<bk>Environmental Investment<weight>7%<bk>Productivity<weight>7%<bk>Pride<weight>7%<bk>corruption<weight>68%<bk>Internal audits<weight>59%<bk>corporate social responsibility<weight>45%<bk>firm<weight>36%<bk>Ideologies<weight>34%<bk>Federal Government<weight>32%<bk>inclusion<weight>26%<bk>expropriation<weight>24%<bk>staff<weight>22%<bk>Independent Commission Against Corruption<weight>22%<bk>successor generation<weight>19%<bk>shareholder-wealth maximization<weight>18%<bk>ideology<weight>14%<bk>state owned company<weight>14%<bk>intersectionality<weight>14%<bk>literature<weight>13%<bk>allies<weight>12%<bk>business practice<weight>11%<bk>discourse analysis<weight>11%<bk>interview<weight>11%<bk>surveillance<weight>10%<bk>best practice<weight>10%<bk>federal police<weight>10%<bk>methodology<weight>9%<bk>management counsulting<weight>9%<bk>sustainability<weight>9%<bk>research project<weight>9%<bk>domination<weight>9%<bk>employee<weight>8%<bk>exploitation<weight>8%<bk>Anti-Corruption<weight>8%<bk>evidence<weight>7%<bk>research planning<weight>7%<bk>discourse<weight>6%<bk>citizen<weight>5%<bk>parliament<weight>5%<bk>public sector<weight>5%,,UC_6158819fd7b0c43ebd755382

6158823cd7b0c43ebd75538c,Psychology,mailto:Clare.Watsford@canberra.edu.au,Clare Watsford,"I am currently employed as a Part-Time Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the University of Canberra and primarily teach into the Master of Clinical Psychology Program (MCP). I am an endorsed Clinical Psychologist with many years of clinical experience working therapeutically with children, adolescents and families, and have pursued research and teach in this area. A driving passion in my teaching, research, supervision and service engagement is bringing together clinical applications and theory to enhance student experience and inform clinical practice to promote engagement and positive clinical outcomes for young people and their families.I have been awarded a total of $460,000 in research funding. In 2019, in collaboration with Professor Rickwood and Dr Buckmaster, I was successfully awarded an external grant from the Capital Health Network (CHN) for $450,000for the project titled  Early Intervention for Mood Regulation in Emerging Adults . This project aims to develop, implement and evaluate an innovative program that addresses the need for more effective early interventions and services for young people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in the ACT. The program will focus on mood regulation for emerging adults (aged 15-21 years) at risk of developing BPD. The program represents an exciting opportunity for the University of Canberra, and will provide UC Master of Clinical Psychology students an opportunity to engage in the research evaluation component of the project as well as an external practicum placement opportunity, involving delivery of the clinical intervention under the supervision of specialised clinical psychologists. The program is also an important service engagement for UC to connect with the wider Canberra community, offering a much-needed evidence-based psychology support options for at risk youth.My current research has a real-world impact, with the results informing clinical practice and service delivery for at risk youth and mothers. My current research focuses on the following:Program evaluation of innovative psychological services and programs for at risk young people, including the BPD Mood Regulation program and a youth step up step down residential program.Examining factors affecting perinatal mental health and optimising psychological wellbeing for mothers as well as attachment with their children.Help-seeking factors in promoting accessing psychological support for young people.I currently supervise three Clinical PhD students at the University of Canberra and engage in clinical supervision with the MCP students. I also engage in research supervision for psychology Honours and Masters students.My teaching philosophy is founded on the incorporation of  real-life  clinical case study examples and the use of interactive role plays to help the students appreciate the application of the theory. This mode of teaching better prepares our graduates to enter the profession with practical and professional skills. I ensure all unit material is current, evidence-based and delivered in an engaging, flexible and collaborative manner. I am committed to applying strategies to my teaching that improve student engagement and retention and in utilising feedback to improve teaching quality. A primary part of my role as a member of the clinical psychology team is to ensure unit content and assessment items are in accordance with Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) requirements and in supporting our students to gain core competencies to graduate as competent, professional and work-ready psychologists.",psychology<weight>100%<bk>curriculum<weight>77%<bk>worldview<weight>36%<bk>audit<weight>35%<bk>social inequality<weight>35%<bk>Compassion Fatigue<weight>100%<bk>Growth<weight>36%<bk>Psychological Burnout<weight>28%<bk>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders<weight>23%<bk>Psychology<weight>16%<bk>Borderline Personality Disorder<weight>100%<bk>Mental Health<weight>70%<bk>Primary Health Care<weight>64%<bk>Episode of Care<weight>38%<bk>Guidelines<weight>35%<bk>Motherhood<weight>100%<bk>Motivation<weight>74%<bk>Depression<weight>60%<bk>Mothers<weight>58%<bk>Ego<weight>52%<bk>Intention<weight>86%<bk>Mental Health Services<weight>100%<bk>Health Services Needs and Demand<weight>29%<bk>Therapeutics<weight>12%<bk>Mental health care<weight>100%<bk>Delivery of Health Care<weight>56%<bk>Hope<weight>17%,Lecturer,Canberra,Motivation<weight>100%<bk>Mental Health Services<weight>86%<bk>Mental Health<weight>47%<bk>Intention<weight>46%<bk>Delivery of Health Care<weight>36%<bk>Compassion Fatigue<weight>34%<bk>Borderline Personality Disorder<weight>30%<bk>Therapeutics<weight>19%<bk>Primary Health Care<weight>19%<bk>Depression<weight>16%<bk>Mothers<weight>15%<bk>Ego<weight>14%<bk>Growth<weight>12%<bk>Episode of Care<weight>11%<bk>Guidelines<weight>10%<bk>Psychological Burnout<weight>9%<bk>Prenatal Education<weight>9%<bk>Parturition<weight>8%<bk>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders<weight>8%<bk>Postpartum Depression<weight>7%<bk>Counseling<weight>7%<bk>Health Services Needs and Demand<weight>6%<bk>Datasets<weight>6%<bk>Child Development<weight>6%<bk>Psychology<weight>5%<bk>Clinical Psychology<weight>5%<bk>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)<weight>5%<bk>Professional Role<weight>5%<bk>Mental health care<weight>27%<bk>psychology<weight>17%<bk>curriculum<weight>13%<bk>clinical outcomes<weight>10%<bk>health care services<weight>8%<bk>age difference<weight>8%<bk>experience<weight>7%<bk>gender-specific factors<weight>6%<bk>worldview<weight>6%<bk>audit<weight>6%<bk>social inequality<weight>6%<bk>education<weight>5%<bk>WHO<weight>5%<bk>contact<weight>5%,,UC_6158823cd7b0c43ebd75538c

For me, this involves understanding the links between landscape, climate and critters, and how these have changed during the Quaternary period – i.e. the last couple of million years. This interest has taken me across Australia and on several trips to Antarctica, the Arctic and Sub-Antarctic Islands and beyond.My research in polar regions has focussed on generating records of past ice sheet changes, which informs ice sheet model development and projections of future sea level rise. I have utilised isotopic tracers such as cosmogenic nuclides to investigate the dynamics of the ice sheets on glacial-interglacial timescales. Much of my existing work has been on-shore, but I m increasingly interested in the offshore part of the system, including developing methods for understanding how ice shelves have functioned in the past.In Australia I have been working to build a picture of how climate and landscapes have evolved during the Quaternary. My teaching program has allowed me to build a diverse understanding of these processes and events, especially in east Australia, and I m starting to apply cosmogenic nuclides to investigate the rates and timing of landscape-scale events in the eastern highlands. I have also leveraged my experience in the geothermal exploration industry to investigate past temperatures across eastern Australia from borehole paleothermometry.Since moving to UC, I ve been exposed to how landscape events affect modern-day patterns of genetic diversity. I m working with colleagues at UC and beyond to help bring a paleo-perspective to the amazing genetic datasets now being generated from critters in Australia and Antarctica.",Galaxiidae<weight>100%<bk>Galaxias<weight>79%<bk>spawning<weight>60%<bk>ecology<weight>49%<bk>fish<weight>28%<bk>land ice<weight>100%<bk>beryllium isotopes<weight>88%<bk>beryllium
