Science,,Regan Ashby,,"Regan graduated with his PhD in Medical Science from the Australian National University in 2007, under the supervision of Professor Ian Morgan. After completing his PhD, Regan received a two year Early Career Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Tuebingen, Germany, as part of the European Union, Marie-Curie European Training Program, with Dr Marita Feldkaemper and Professor Frank Schaeffel. On returning to Australia, Regan took up a lecturing position at the University of Canberra in 2011 before accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty in 2012. He now heads the Visual Neuroscience Group within the Centre for Research into Therapeutic Solutions (Health Research Institute).Regan's research focuses on the molecular pathways underlying the regulation of normal ocular growth, and how such neural pathways are affected during the development of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness). Myopia is now at epidemic proportion in many parts of the world, most notably in urban East Asia, where 80-90% of school-leavers are myopic. Recently, Regan's research has shown that exposure to bright light levels; similar to that experienced by being outdoors, can prevent the development of experimental myopia in animal models. This protection appears to be driven by light-induced increases in the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the eye. This work has culminated in Regan being awarded the prestigious Attempto Prize for Neuroscience, from the University of Tuebingen, Germany (2010), and the Carl Zeiss Young Investigators Award in Vision Science (2013). Regan's current research looks at better understanding the genomic and epigenomic regulatory mechanisms by which exposure to high light levels can retard the development of myopia.Research interestsInvestigating the underlying causes of the visual disorder myopia (short-sightedness)Genomic/epigenomic regulation of ocular growthRetinal neural development",Associate Professor,Canberra,61585aa8d7b0c43ebd7551e2,Canberra61585aa8d7b0c43ebd7551e2

Science,Nicole.Beard@canberra.edu.au,Nicole Beard,,"Dr Beard and her research team investigate how intracellular calcium signaling pathways initiate muscle contraction. We explore and define the mechanisms which lead to control of calcium signalling and the way in which these are disrupted in skeletal myopathies, cardiomyopathy and heart failure.Muscle contraction occurs due to a cascade of events and relies on calcium release from intracellular stores. The four main cogs in the intracellular calcium signalling pathway are the calcium binding protein calsequestrin (CSQ), the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channel, and two linking proteins - triadin and junctin - which bind CSQ to the RyR. Control of calcium release in muscle is vital; disturbances in the process can lead to potentially fatal skeletal and cardiac conditions.Despite their essential role in skeletal muscle and the heart, the functional and structural interactions between the proteins that drive calcium signalling are poorly understood and form the broad aims of our research.Currently funded projects include:Calcium signalling by intracellular calcium stores: implications for muscle performance and athletic abilityCalcium homeostatis disturbances and human heart failureUnderstanding how chemotherapy agents cause cardiotoxicityResearch interestsHeart failureCardiomyopathySkeletal muscle ageing and myopathy",Associate Professor,Canberra,61585bfbd7b0c43ebd7551f2,Canberra61585bfbd7b0c43ebd7551f2

I am specialising employing qualitative research to gain a holistic and in-depth understanding of the individual and contextual/environmental (historical, natural/build, interpersonal, social, cultural, spiritual, economic, political) factors and processes that empower humans and communities effectively managing and even thriving in the face of change, uncertainty, risk and adversity. To this end, I am passionately working in projects that create living in harmony with nature/environment and each other by exploring.adaptive capacities (individual and community)transformation of mind and behaviourtransformative educationleadership, team work and collaborationIndigenous knowledgesspirituality and alternative healing approachesI am exploring these research foci in the areas of natural extreme events and disasters, migration and Indigenous communities.For over 15 years, I have been investigating the interaction of psychological and environmental factors that influence risk reduction, preparedness and response for various natural hazards (bushfire, tsunami, earthquakes) and pandemics in different countries (Australia, USA, NZ). In terms of migration, I have been exploring in-depth and longitudinally the interaction of psychological and contextual/environmental factors and processes that facilitate transformation, successful migration, and well-being/health. Recently, I was the principal researcher for the $12.4 million project with six Australian Indigenous Communities in Northern Australia. This project was awarded several awards including the NAIDOC 2016 award for theBest Environmental Project. Currently, I am co-leading a Indigenous participatory action research that is facilitating Indigenous Australian and Taiwanese communities visiting each other and exchanging knowledges, skills and cultural practices using arts healing to strengthen Indigenous peoples/communities and to (re)build living in harmony with nature, self and others. I am also a CI on the NHMRC MRFF ""Supporting mental health through building resilience during and after bushfires: Lessons from the 2019-20 bushfires in NSW and the ACT"".I am bringing to my work an inter-disciplinary (natural science, psychology, anthropology, sociology), inter-sectional (academia, business, NGO, government), and international (Germany, New Zealand, Australia) and inter-societal (former East Germany) background.So far, I authored and co-authored over 70 books, chapters, peer-reviewed papers, state and federal government reports, and national and international conference presentations in the fields of disaster preparedness and risk management, international migration, and collaboration (Scopus h-index: 8).

Canberra Business School,,David Carter,,"I am the Research Lead in the Canberra Business School in the Faculty of Business, Government and Law.My research examines the politics of information concerning accounting, law, politics, regulation, and discourses of capital. My work is trans-disciplinary and concerns how information (including metrics, economics, accounting and statistics) is used within legal and political processes, which explores the interface of law and regulation within government, public policy, corporate, regulatory and litigation settings. Traditionally, information is presented in legal and political environments as apolitical, objective and capable of resolving problems and conflicts. My research investigates the politics of 'information', depicting the role of information at methodological, technical, and political levels.I draw on a range of post-structural theory in my work, including Laclau and Mouffe, Hardt and Negri, Lazzarato, Gramsci, Luxemburg, Marx, and have a deep interest in jurisprudential theory, research philosophy and post-colonial literatures.

Creative & Cultural Practice,Dudley.Creagh@canberra.edu.au,Dudley Creagh,,"SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF MY RESEARCH INVOLVEMENT 1957 -2018AttachmentsNational/International Involvement -- Summary of Executed Designs 鈥揌onours and Awards  My research career started in1957 with the commencement of the fourth (Honours) year of my Physics course at Queensland University. My field study was Ionospheric Physics. I was awarded 1st Class Honours for a thesis entitled: The design of a correlation computer for the resolution of radio fading data. The computer was devised in an era before transistors and digital technology existed. I trained at the University of Queensland Faculty of Education as a Science Teacher in 1957 and in 1958 was posted to teach at the Toowoomba State High School and Technical College. Whilst in Toowoomba I surveyed the Toowoomba area for an appropriate site for an Atmospheric Whistler experimental station for Professor Hugh Webster (Physics: University of Queensland).University of New England In 1959 I was invited by Professor Jack Somerville to take up a position as Lecturer in Physics at the University of New England. My research field changed from Ionospheric Physics to Plasma Physics. In this new field of research I studied the evolution of the conducting channel which is created when a spark occurs between electrodes. I developed a new experimental methodology and created the equipment to implement the research. This research resulted in the award of an MSc for a thesis entitled: The decay of spark channels which have ceased to carry current. These were the first observations of the complete temporal evolution of electric sparks and defined the time at which the conducting channel of the spark could be a conduit for a further spark.Royal Military College, Duntroon My next appointment (1962) was at the Royal Military College of Australia (RMC) as a Lecturer in Physics where I continued my research in Plasma Physics. When the Snowy Mountains Laboratory disposed of their 6m Hilger High Resolution Optical Spectrometer, I acquired it and had it installed at RMC. I adapted it to enable studies of the cross-sectional temperature distribution in low current electric arcs to be performed. And I devised a novel transistor-controlled power supply to stabilize the emission from these arcs so that precise spectral measurements could be made.University College, University of New South Wales From 1962 to 1968 courses at RMC evolved, as RMC as an institution made the transition to being a College of the University of New South Wales. The field of Solid State Physics was seen as an essential element of the new BSc Degree structure and to teach it, new equipment was acquired and brought into operation. The new equipment included transmission and scanning electron microscopes, an X-ray diffractometer, and an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. In 1965 I received a Commonwealth Post Graduate Scholarship to undertake the MSc course in the Physics of Materials at the University of Bristol. The research element of this degree involved the development of an X-ray interferometer, and its use for the measurement of X-ray refractive indices. I was awarded an MSc for a thesis entitled: The measurement of X-ray refractive indices using an X-ray interferometer. This led to further research in the field of X-ray scattering. The X-ray interferometer studies on alkali halides enabled precise determinations of the X-ray anomalous dispersion corrections to be made. These parameters need to be known accurately because they are used extensively in the quantitative analysis of X-ray diffraction data. My experiments showed that a discrepancy existed between the current theoretical predictions and the experimental results. The theories at that time were based on non-relativistic models of photon scattering. I developed a relativistic quantum mechanical multipole model of photon scattering which gave predictions in close agreement with the experimental data. On my return to RMC I continued research into measuring the temperature distribution in electric arcs. And I continued my work on X-ray scattering, devising equipment which could measure X-ray absorption with greater precision than had hitherto been achieved. The scattering and absorption processes are physically linked, so the results of an interferometry experiment could be used to predict the anomalous dispersion corrections and vice versa. Professor GVH Wilson became Professor of Physics at RMC in 1971. His field of research was Condensed Matter Physics, in particular, studies of magnetic materials such as the cobalt, samarium, holmium, and the cubic Laves phase intermetallics, GdFe2, GdCo2 and GdAl2. in the years 1970 to 1982 I was involved in the study of the structure and properties of these materials using X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ferromagnetic resonance, and the Mossbauer effect. I enrolled for a PhD degree in the field of X-ray Scattering in 1972 and in 1975 was awarded that degree for a thesis entitled Measurement of X-ray dispersion corrections and mass absorption coefficients for various halides. I took Sabbatical Leave in 1977 at the (then) US National Bureau of Standards (NBS) working there with John Hubbell. The NBS awarded me their Citation for Excellence for research completed there. In 1978 I received an invitation from the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) to set up an international round-robin experiment for the measurement of X-ray attenuation coefficients. World-wide, eleven international laboratories participated in the experiment. They were provided with sets of well- characterized specimens. I characterized the materials using a wide range of physical techniques and I later performed experiments on these specimens, replicating the experimental arrangements used by the participating laboratories. The results of this study led to improvements in the quality of data collected experimentally, and the accuracy of the theoretical computations of X-ray attenuation coefficients. In 1979 I was awarded a French Government Scientific and Technical Fellowship. I worked with Professor Erwin Bertaut at the Institute Laue Langevin, Grenoble, on group theoretical studies of magnetic spin ordering in solids; and with Professor Andre Authier (University of Paris V: Pierre and Marie Curie) on the possibility of observing nuclear anomalous scattering in cadmium sulphide using neutron scattering.Australian Defence Force Academy In the early 1980s, developments relating to the education of officers of the Australian Defence Force saw the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), an amalgamation of the existing service colleges (Army: RMC; Air Force: Point Cook; Navy: Jervis Bay). With this came new courses and the need to design experimental suites for the new Physics Building. These suites were to house new electron microscopes (which needed electromagnetically shielded rooms and antivibration flooring), together with the specimen preparation areas. As well, facilities for X-ray Diffraction, Laue Diffraction, and X-ray topography were designed and the equipment was brought into service. I was responsible for the planning management and maintenance of these facilities. In 1988 I was invited by the IUCr to contribute chapters on X-ray scattering to their handbook, International Tables for Crystallography Volume C (ITC), which serves as a source of reference data for more than 100,000 researchers worldwide. I wrote five chapters for this volume: on X-ray spectra, X-ray attenuation, X-ray dispersion corrections, monochromators, and precautions against radiation injury. The chapters on X-ray dispersion and X-ray attenuation contained data calculated using my relativistic multipole X-ray scattering theory. These were compared with the most recent experimental results. In 1989 I was invited by the Academia Sinica to give lecture courses on modern X-ray scattering theory and practice. The President of the Academia Sinica presented me with the Chinese Chemical Society medal in recognition of my service to the Chinese Academy of Science. During the 1980s research activities were diverse. I remained involved in the study of ferro-magnetic materials, both elemental and rare-earth intermetallic, using a variety of pulsed nuclear magnetic techniques. Other scientific technologies were changing rapidly. In 1984, in my capacity as Chairman of the Commission on Crystallographic Apparatus of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), I was invited by the Director and the Japanese scientists to construct an Australian beamline at the Japanese synchrotron, the Photon Factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan). This was identified as the Australian National Beamline Facility (ANBF). Obtaining funding for this enterprise was a momentous task. As Chairman of the Australian Synchrotron Radiation Users Group I made numerous submissions to the relevant Commonwealth Government Agencies, the Australian Academy of Science, the Academy of Science Technology and Engineering Council, and the Australian Research Council. Eventually in 1992 the president of the Australian Research Council (ARC), Professor Don Aitken, managed to convene a consortium including the ARC, the CSIRO, Ansto, the University College UNSW (ADFA) and the Australian National University to undertake the project. The Australian Academy of Science (AAS) was also a member of the consortium but contributed no financial assistance. In the period 1992-1997 I designed the X-ray beamline and planned for all the associated facilities which supported its operation (the experimental hutch, the container house and its furnishings, vehicle).I supervised the construction of the complete system: beamline, monochromator, diffractometer and the integrated electronic control and data analysis systems. The beamline and X-ray monochromator were constructed in the Physics Department at ADFA in Canberra; the furniture for the container house in nearby Queanbeyan NSW; negotiations with Toyota Australia resulted in the provision of a vehicle in Japan. The unique vacuum diffractometer (designed by Stephen Wilkins (CSIRO) and myself) was constructed by the Materials Division CSIRO. Accessories for the diffractometer were designed and developed by my team at ADFA. This was the first dedicated Australian synchrotron facility and educated a new generation of Australian scientists. In 1993 I was awarded a (Japanese Government) Monbusho Technical Fellowship which funded four months residence in Japan thus enabling me to supervise the installation of the beamline and all its components. The Australian National Beamline Facility (ANBF: BL20B, Photon Factory, KEK, Tsukuba, Japan), became operational in late1993. Because the initial funding was for just three years, further funding had to be sought to maintain its operation after 1997. Australian Government support was forthcoming in 1998 under the Major National Research Facilities Program. This ensured the ANBF was able to remain in operation to 2002. When the Australian Synchrotron was funded in 2002 the ANBF became part of the Australian Synchrotron's research program. When the ANBF was decommissioned in 2015 it had been used by many hundreds of Australian scientists. Whilst on sabbatical leave at the ANU Research School of Chemistry (RSC) in 1996 I designed a unique liquid-air interface Small Angle Scattering System. This enabled the RSC to commence a wide range of research projects on the processes taking place at the liquid-air interface using X-ray Reflectivity. Design and construction of this system led me to the design of other equipment which would later be used at synchrotron radiation sources for the study of self-organizing protective wax coatings on metal surfaces; the tensile testing of elastomers and carbon fibres; fracture toughness of acronitrile copolymers; studies of epitaxial layers grown on semiconductor surfaces (such as GaAs multi-well quantum effect and quantum dot semiconductor devices). My involvement in the scientific conservation of cultural materials commenced in 1988 through a collaboration with the Australian War Memorial (AWM) where their conservation staff were restoring a Japanese Zero fighter for display. They needed to be certain that the composition of the aluminium they proposed using would be compatible with the Zero's airframe. This was to be the first of many collaborations with a diverse range of national and international collecting institutions. Significant amongst these were studies of all the Victoria Crosses in the custody of the AWM and the Waiouru Museum in New Zealand, and a study of the (German) Lusitania Medal. I retired from ADFA in 1996, leaving to take the position of Professor of the Physics of Materials at the University of Canberra.University of Canberra Here, research has proceeded on a number of different fronts, and involves collaborations with other faculties of the university, other Australian universities, major national and international facilities, and with Australian Government departments and instrumentalities. Overseas collaborations have included, inter alia, the US National institute of Science and Technology (NIST), the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands, the Royal Armouries in the UK, and the US Naval Research Laboratory. More recently my research has been conducted in the following fields: X-ray Scattering, the design of advanced scientific equipment, Cultural Heritage studies, Forensic Science, Border Protection, and Schools of Arts Buildings in Australia.X-ray Scattering I am a leading international expert on X-ray Scattering. I have submitted (2017) complete revisions of tables, on the fundamental scattering parameters for atoms, for inclusion in International Tables for Crystallography Volume C (with Professor Chris Chantler). This includes a total of six chapters on the Production of X-rays, X-ray Spectra, X-ray Absorption, Monochromators, and the X-ray Dispersion Corrections. The latter chapter includes the most recent calculations of the scattering parameters by Chantler and Creagh and comparisons with recent experimental data. As well, the section on Precautions against Injury has been revised to include the most recent regulatory requirements for work with ionizing radiation. Research with collaborators at the University of Melbourne and Latrobe University into X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) continues and chapters for the new International Tables for Crystallography Volume I are ready for submission to the editor. At the ceremony marking the closure of the ANBF at the Photon Factory in 2013 the International X-ray Absorption Society conferred on me a Lifetime Achievement Award. The International Radiation Physics Society (IRPS) conferred on me their Lifetime Achievement Award at their 2015 Congress in Beijing.Cultural Heritage  For 30 years I have maintained close collaborations with the National collecting institutions (the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia, The National Film and Sound Archive, the National Museum of Australia). These collaborations have led to research funded by the Australian Research Council including: the protection of base metals from corrosion; the protection of outdoor statuary; the degradation of bark paintings (which has led to improved techniques for mounting, display and conservation of bark paintings); the study of the degradation of inks on paper, pigments on surfaces, and photographic film. Studies have been made on Joe Byrne's armour, shrapnel and artefacts from HMAS Sydney, and paints used by the 鈥淎ngry Penguins鈥?school of Australian paintings. More recently, in a collaboration with the Rijksmuseum (The Netherlands), the Queen Victoria Museum and Gallery (Tasmania), and the West Australian Gallery, I have been involved in X-ray synchrotron radiation studies of the Dirk Hartog plate (which is a Dutch national treasure) and 19th century easel paintings. As well, synchrotron radiation has been used to collect data in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum to assist in the authentication of important easel paintings.Design of Advanced Scientific Equipment From 2002 to 2008 I designed the Infrared Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, regarded currently by international researchers as the most stable and versatile Infrared beamline in the world. I remained involved in the maintenance of the ANBF at the KEK, Tsukuba, Japan, and improved its capabilities, especially in the field of X-ray Absorption Fine Structures (XAFS) through ARC funded grants. I had designed the X-ray beamline at this facility in 1992. With Ansto scientists I designed and developed a methodology, including the testing devices, for evaluating the performance of each of the types of X-ray systems used for air cargo and shipping container examination (2008 -2012). These devices have been patented and are in production. In 2013 I devised an X-ray system which enabled the examination of marine artefacts which were raised from, and re-interred in a shipwreck, as part of the Australian Historical Shipwreck Preservation Project. The X-ray system allowed the simultaneous recording of 3D-optical and X-ray images. Research is continuing in X-ray phase contrast imaging and the development of systems to evaluate computed tomography (CT) systems. I remain involved in the development of standards for the testing of systems used by Border Protection Agencies. Currently I serve on International Committees to assess the performance of: X-ray systems used at passenger portals at airports (NIST/AINSI: F792); CT systems used at passenger portals; as well as bottle and can examination systems (Comit茅 International Electrotechnique).Forensic Science Research in this field covers a wide range of materials and the use of a diverse range of experimental techniques, much of which is confidential. Studies of street drugs and steroids have been undertaken using Raman spectroscopy. More recently (2015) a study of the estimation of the postmortem degradation interval of skeletal remains has been made using Infrared Spectroscopy.Border Protection From 2000 to 2015 I was Scientific Adviser to the Australian Customs Service (now Border Protection in the Department of Home Affairs), giving advice on a wide range of problems, but mostly on matters involving the use of X-rays. I was responsible, for example, for the acquisition of the high energy-high intensity X-ray systems used in the examination of container systems at the maritime border, the intermediate-energy intermediate-intensity X-ray systems used in air- cargo operations, and the X-ray, infrared/THz/Raman scattering and ion-beam mobility systems used at the passenger portals at airports. I have been the principal author of a number of reports to Australian Government departments (the Department of Infrastructure, the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Forestry and Fisheries). I drafted the regulations which are used for security monitoring of passengers at airline portals.Schools of Arts/Mechanics鈥?Institutes in AustraliaAs part of a wider study of the evolution of the School of Arts Movement I am writing short histories of Schools of Arts in the Canning Downs region of the Darling Downs (Southern Queensland). I have written four so far, with a further three in preparation. The School of Arts Movement commenced in Australia in Hobart in1827, and grew to have about 3000 buildings throughout Australia in 1900. This was an important element of education in Australia, especially in the 19th century, often predating government-funded school systems (which appeared about 1850) and it was a precursor to what we now call adult (or further) education. Importantly, because state-funded libraries did not come into existence until the 1940s Schools of Arts also provided access to lending libraries. The movement was the precursor to technical education, and even museums - in many towns they were called Mechanics鈥?Institutes. This work is important because it enables the study of the social history of the communities, small and large, poor and wealthy, which supported this movement and benefited from what it offered. Much of the information has been lost, or is in danger of being lost.Executed designsExecuted designsThe physical scale of equipment I have designed ranges from the very large to the very small: from beamlines at synchrotron radiation facilities to adapting and improving techniques for the preparation of specimens for use in electron microscopy using microtomes. For example:The design of the Infrared Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, which international researchers say is the most stable and versatile Infrared beamline in the world (2002-2008)I was involved in the development, construction and maintenance of the ANBF at the synchrotron radiation source, the Photon Factory (KEK, Tsukuba, Japan) through ARC funded grants. I designed the X-ray beamline, its monochromators, and its ancillary components such as an eight-position capillary spinning stage for its unique X-ray diffractometer (1992-2002).For the Research School of Chemistry, ANU, I designed a system for the study of the reflection and diffraction of X-rays from surfaces and interfaces, especially the formation of monolayers on liquid surfaces (1996).I designed a system for evaluating the performance of X-ray systems used for air cargo and shipping container examinations during testing of commercial large tunnel X-ray systems for the Office of Transport Security. The prototype for this system constructed in the workshops at Ansto was used in the OTS trials. It has since been patented, is now in commercial production (2008-2013).Research is proceeding in X-ray phase contrast imaging and the development of systems to evaluate computed tomography (CT) systems as part of a collaboration with NIST and CIEI designed an X-ray system to be used on a jacked-up barge above the wreck of the 鈥淐larence鈥?for the Australian Historical Shipwrecks Preservation Project (AHSPP). This enabled 2-D X-ray images to be reconstituted as 3D- images which would then be compared with 3D- optical photographic images (2013).I designed microprocessor-based laboratory data acquisition system to lower the cost of providing instrumentation in student laboratories (1982).I designed a system for the precise measurement of X-ray attenuation coefficients as part of the IUCr X-ray Attenuation Project (1978).Because equipment was not commercially available for studies of defects in crystals, especially semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide I designed a low cost q axis and linear slide for X-ray topography (1972).A simple low-cost device for the stabilization of dc electric arcs was designed and constructed in 1968.",Emeritus Professor,Canberra,61585ec8d7b0c43ebd755222,Canberra61585ec8d7b0c43ebd755222

Health Research Institute,,Mark Daniel,,"Mark Daniel is Professor of Epidemiology in the Health Research Institute, University of Canberra where he leads the Spatial Epidemiology Group. He is concurrently appointed Professorial Fellow in the Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, The University of Melbourne, and Senior Principal Research Fellow at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.Mark Daniel holds a Doctorate in Health Care & Epidemiology (University of British Columbia, 1998), Master of Science (University of Manitoba, 1991) and Bachelor of Science (Simon Fraser University, 1989). He first encountered Australia as an MRC Canada Postdoctoral Fellow, based in Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, for two years. He then held faculty appointments in the School of Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the Department of Social & Preventive Medicine, Universit茅 de Montr茅al (as Canada Research Chair: Population Health). He immigrated to Australia in 2008, joining the University of South Australia as Research S.A. Chair: Social Epidemiology and Director: Spatial Epidemiology and Evaluation Research Group. In 2012 he became inaugural Head: School of Population Health. Mark joined the University of Canberra in 2017. He has authored 182 refereed articles and 21 book chapters. He has given 106 invited presentations. His work has been presented at 273 refereed congresses. He has been a chief investigator (CI) on 102 grants exceeding $67.5 M, from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Canada Foundation for Innovation, National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia, and Australian Research Council. His grant funding for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was $5.6M, $4.7M, $5.1M, $4.7M and $4.6M, respectively (as CI-A: $576K, $566K, $505K, $451K and $312K for the same years, respectively). He has led 30 grant-funded projects.Mark's emphasis is the intersection of spatial epidemiology and prevention research, particularly the prevention of non-communicable disease and understanding the biological pathways between social and physical environments and important population health outcomes and costs. His work aims to identify the drivers and multi-sectoral levers for policy- and practice-level innovations to reduce risk factors and slow rising rates of chronic disease including obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and cancers related to lifestyle. At the core of his research is the geospatial modelling of area-level factors in inferential analyses of risk factors such as diet, physical activity and smoking, and biochemical/clinical outcomes as these vary over time and change in response to public health and clinical intervention. For 18 years Mark has used GIS 'geographic information systems 'in spatial analyses of multi-level relationships between social and built environmental factors and chronic disease risk factors and outcomes, emphasising factors that are amenable to local action and policy. He has also used GIS for the evaluation of field experiments, including prevention trials in general and vulnerable populations. Most of this work aims at knowledge translation for improved population health through meaningful partnerships with stakeholders including community leaders, health professionals, and policy makers.Mark has sustained a strong commitment to Aboriginal health throughout his career. He has led community-based research in participatory collaborations with Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Australia, since 1994. Articles reporting this research have contributed to understandings of: (i) the environmental contexts of cardiometabolic diseases in Aboriginal peoples; (ii) direct and indirect pathways underlying these associations, for which the explanatory mechanisms operate not simply via volitional behaviour, but through the non-volitional behaviours and social norms that define lifestyle, and psychosocial and biological responses to chronic stressors; and (iii) conceptual and methodological challenges faced in field research, and solutions for prevention science, in the rigorous evaluation of community-based and population-level intervention programs.Research and Teaching InterestsPopulation health, social epidemiology; spatial epidemiology; chronic, noncommunicable and communicable disease epidemiology; disease prevention; prevention intervention planning, implementation and evaluation; evaluation research including cluster randomised trails and quasi-experimental trials in applied field settings to determine effectiveness for policy and practice.Supervision and MentoringMark has supervised to completion 17 PhD, 14 MSc (thesis) and 4 Honours students. Former students hold faculty positions at prominent institutions including Stanford University, University of California - Los Angeles, University of Miami, Columbia University, and Universit茅 Laval. Still others hold senior managerial positions in not-for-profit/ non-government health agencies or government epidemiology roles (Public Health Agency of Canada, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Mark has also directed 13 Postdoctoral Fellows, and been official mentor to 4 Early Career Researchers. Currently, he supervises 5 PhD students.Contribution to Field of ResearchMark built in Montr茅al a key infrastructure to support effective population health decision making, the Megaphone geographic information system (a copyrighted, registered invention). Megaphone is now applied by public health authorities across Qu茅bec. Analyses from Megaphone contributed to a ban on fast food and vending machines in schools. Extensions with Canadian funders focus on interventions within schools to improve healthful eating. Since 2006, Megaphone has been used in 36 projects with grants funding of $24.7M, yielding more than 70 publications. Megaphone is the basis of the new national Australian Epidemiological GIS (AEGIS) that Mark's team is developing in Canberra in an industry partnership with ESRI Australia, the world leader for GIS development. The AEGIS platform is a 2nd generation version of the Megaphone infrastructure that incorporates advances in geospatial database construction, analytic applications, and visual representation. An exciting extension of AEGIS is its role underpinning spatial epidemiological analyses of diabetes in partnership with the Dasman Diabetes Institute, Kuwait, via its integration with a diabetes registry.Collaborations and Community EngagementMark has engaged in 46 industry, government and community initiatives in Australasia, Canada and the USA, India (International Clinical Epidemiology Network), France (Institut national de la sant茅 et de la recherche m茅dicale) and Kuwait (Ministry of Health and Dasman Diabetes Institute) (14 of which remain current in 2018). He has led community-based fieldwork with primary data collection in Canada, the USA, India and Australia.

My current research explores the role and mechanisms for more participatory forms of governance within rural and regional communities. This includes (i) understanding the socio-political community context, including existing power relations, networks and institutions; (ii) identifying current governance arrangements and the strengths and weaknesses, including existing forms of participation across the community; iii) identifying, often in collaboration with communities, how to support positive community engagement processes in policy governance, industry and NRM contexts, and (iv) communicating the diversity of research findings into outcomes accessible by a range of audiences including policy-makers, community members and stakeholders. I have undertaken a range of projects across water management, community development, forest management and agricultural sectors.Specifically, my academic interests focus on:Community engagement strategy development and training for the forest sector and other stakeholders including NRM agencies and local government.Improving engagement between communities, decision makers and experts to promote effective decision making.Governance within regional communities. Understanding the differences between communities and how to work with communities for sustainable futures.

Rachel has extensive experience of conducting large-scale trials in both clinical and community settings in the area of physical activity, health and disease prevention. More recently, Rachel has focused on the use and development of ecological models that emphasize multiple levels of influence on health behaviours. She has designed and led large-scale community interventions that have resulted in sustained behaviour change and improved health. Rachel has also led pioneering research that takes an ecological approach to sustaining and improving health, such as the United Kingdom Medical Research Council funded project ""An ecological approach to promoting health-enhancing physical activity in a deprived inner-city population"" that involved detailed mapping of the environment and evaluation of the relationship between environment, physical activity and health and health outcomes. Her research takes an integrated urban ecosystem approach to evaluating the influences of the built, natural and social environments on health behaviours, health and health outcomes. Rachel currently collaborates with the international team of researchers in the 12 country IPEN study that aims to pool data from over 14000 participants across the globe to better our understanding of environmental correlates of physical activity and obesity. Empirical findings from this trans-national research on these complex interactions will help inform policy and practice for future urban designhttp://www.ipenproject.org/IPEN_adult.htmlResearchInterestsRachel's research interests focus on policy-relevant research in areas related to physical activity for health and wellbeing and on the design, delivery and evaluation of complex public health interventions.

The first is an ongoing empirical effort to catalog democracy's adjectives 'so far 1,217 have been found in the English literature 'and to inquire about what knowing these adjectives may come to mean or be used for. The second is to continue contributing to the theory of non-human democracy by trying to draw lessons for human democracies from the practices of non-human others (e.g. how do different non-human species solve collective action problems and what, from this, resonates with the theory or practice of democracy today?). The third is to contribute to globalising the history of democracy from a democratic theory perspective which interacts with what John Keane, Benjamin Isakhan, Yves Schemeil, Steve Muhlberger and Phil Paine, and Martin Bernal, among others, have been doing.His recent publications and interests span democracy's many histories (forgotten democracies, narrative, comparison, discourse analysis, epistemology, is democracy even human?), finding ways forward among a number of problems or puzzles that democracies presently face (democracies across dialogues; democracy education / civics and young people, democracy apps, critical and normative arguments, political reform), and critically theorizing the futures of democracy 'those 鈥榙emocracies to come鈥?(Isaiah Berlin, fiction, posthumanism, futurism, normative arguments, Anthropocene / Holocene democracy).Please contact for: - Research collaboration - PhD, Master's, Honour's supervision - AdvocacyTo view Jean-paul's The Conversationprofile, please click here.",Senior Lecturer,Canberra,61586356d7b0c43ebd755258,Canberra61586356d7b0c43ebd755258

The NCFS is a collaboration between the UC, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Canberra Institute of Technology (CiT).Dr Hoogewerff studied geochemistry (M.Sc.) and volcanology (Ph.D.) at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands (1984-1993). The emphasis of his work was, and still is, using inorganic elemental and isotope ratio analysis to trace any natural material to its geographical origin.During his PhD research he investigated the contribution of the Australian crust to volcanism in Eastern Indonesia. In 1993 Dr Hoogewerff joined the Department of Health Sciences of University Maastricht to teach environmental sciences and develop tracers for the origin of pollutants from their source to environmental and biological targets including human tissues.Dr Hoogewerff transferred to the Geotechnical Institute Arsenal Research in Vienna in 1996 where he continued his environmental exposure research, combining epidemiological data with newly created geochemical maps. Here he also started to apply his techniques for forensic casework and archaeological provenancing. His study on 5000 year old ""Otzi"" was the first isotope study on the Tyrolean Iceman.With an EU grant in 1999 Dr Hoogewerff established the global analytical forensic network NITECRIME that included major national forensic research institutes like the NFI, BKA, US Customs and FBI. In 2006 NITECRIME almagated with the Forensic Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry network and Dr Hoogewerff was involved in its management until 2014. In 2000 Dr Hoogewerff moved to the Institute of Food Research in Norwich to manage their isotope facility for food forensics applications and human metabolism studies. Together with other colleagues he initiated the EU funded TRACE project (Euro20M) using the compositional links between soil and food for determining the geographical origin of food products to combat counterfeiting.Dr Hoogewerff was Senior Lecturer at the University of East Anglia in Norwich UK from 2006 to 2011 and developed and managed their ""Forensic and Investigative Chemistry"" four year MChem program. In September 2011 he relocated to Dunedin in New Zealand and first served one year as part-time Chief Scientist and Co-Director of Oritain Ltd. and then continued as Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Otago to expand their Forensic Analytical Science Program until December 2014.In January 2015 Dr Hoogewerff moved to the NCFS.

She won the 1996 Blackburn Medal for Research in Law for a paper on constitutional rights and criminal due process, which was subsequently published in the Federal Law Review and cited in a judgement of the High Court of Australia. As an undergraduate Janet worked as a Research Associate to Chief Justice Miles of the ACT Supreme Court, conducting an investigation into the historic role of the Federal Court of Australia as a court of criminal appeal for the ACT. Janet qualified to practise in 1997 and worked for several years as a barrister in Australia and New Zealand, primarily in conflict resolution, administrative, human rights and employment law.Janet received her PhD in Law from the Australian National University in 2005, winning an open national award for communicating scholarly information to lay audiences. From 2000 to 2009 she was a pioneer of efforts to translate the open source model from software to biotechnology, a key agenda item for scholars working to develop socially just models of intellectual property and innovation management. Hope's international prize-winning 2008 book, BioBazaar (Harvard University Press), was the first systematic exposition of the open source model outside the software context, offering a detailed conceptual framework to support further development of the model in biotech and elsewhere. During the period 2005-2009 Janet was employed in the Australian National University's Regulatory Institutions Network (RegNet), initially as an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow. and later as Senior Fellow. Between 2005 and 2009 she led two successful ARC Discovery Project grant applications in the field of open source biotechnology.The broad impact of Janet's work in this field was evidenced by invitations to speak at numerous international conferences and workshops and by citations in a wide variety of publication types, from academic books and refereed journals in several disciplines, through reports of international think tanks, foundations and intergovernmental organisations such as the OECD, to international specialist and generalist periodicals including The Economist. Janet also contributed to emerging practice by organising international events, consulting and advising on implementation of the open source biotech model in international organisations and public and private sectors in Australia, Canada and the US, and serving in leadership roles in two international non-profit organisations.In 2011, Janet's volunteer experience over 20 years advocating for victims of crime in the spheres of disability, health, mental health and financial compensation led her to step out of academia and retrain as a professional coach. From 2013 to 2020 she built a thriving 鈥渋nternational micro-business鈥?serving hundreds of individual and organisational clients around the world, primarily in the higher education sector. Janet holds the International Coach Federation's senior practitioner credential (PCC), has held leadership roles within her local ACT branch and is a founding member of the European Mentoring and Coaching Council (Asia-Pacific Region).

He approaches architecture as a conceptual and material enquiry and his international research achievements rest on a large portfolio of work that investigates three strands in architecture practice and theory. The first strand engages in the critical analysis and re-interpretation of modernist architectural discourses with a particular emphasis on the second half of the 20th century. The second focuses on theories of architecture composition at multiple scales and temporal settings: from individual buildings, to group form, to precinct and city scales. The third strand concerns the conceptualisation and delivery of complex architectural and urban scale projects. This research performance is expanded by contributions to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge through his teaching in international and national settings and through academic and professional engagement activities. International and national refereed publications, grants, conference presentations, and committee work in peak bodies with national policy impact demarcate these contributions and ensure their impact.He was Visiting Scholar (2015) at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation, and Visiting Scholar (2019, 2013) at the American Academy in Rome. He has published extensively in the discipline's peak academic journals and lectured broadly giving peer-reviewed papers in conferences in Abu Dhabi, Adelaide, Antwerp, Auckland, Brussels, Canberra, Copenhagen, Ghent, Helsinki, Launceston, Melbourne, New York City, Paris, Seoul, Stockholm, Sydney, Tampere, Val猫ncia, Venice, and Wellington. He is the author of Architectural Aesthetic Speculations, Deleuze on Art and the forthcoming Architectural Possibilities in the Work of Peter Eisenman (Routledge)and Trajectories in Architecture (Routledge).He is currently working on several long-term projects including a revised account of modernist architectural knowledge, a history of the architectural plan as conceptual device, and investigations into resilient urban scale form with an initial focus on multi-unit housing,TEACHINGJasper's teaching practice has been delivered in a body of work distinctive for its intellectual rigor, scholarly depth, and discipline impact. His teaching has been delivered through advanced architecture studios, major project urban-scale studios; advanced seminars in architecture formal analysis and composition. He has also led and taught in the professional practice and elective studies streams. Professor Jasper's teaching develops translational knowledge across three domains: form generation, architecture knowledge, and complex urban-scale design.In the period 2017-2019 his teaching received an averaged overall satisfaction with unit quality InterFace Student Experience Questionnaire score of 97%, well above the 78% UC average.Starting in 2011, he has led the internationalization of the UC architecture program, initiating and securing funding for a series of postgraduate overseas research studios based in Beijing (2011, 2012), Venice (2014), and Tokyo (2015-). The Tokyo-based postgraduate unit celebrated its fifth consecutive year in 2019 and is now an established and distinguishing part of the curriculum, the program currently suspended due to COVID19 related travel restrictions. He has been Master of Architecture Course Convenor from December 2015 and in that capacity led the course in the implementation of a revised curriculum from 2016 and over the national accreditation reporting period of Semester 2 2016 through Semester 1 2018.

I lecture across the undergraduate, honours, and master's courses at UC and provide research and clinical supervision to students. My previous roles include: Associate Professor of Evolutionary Psychology and Head of Psychology (ISN Psychology); Principal ISN Research Fellow (Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health); Acting Associate Head of School: Research, Discipline Head: Psychology, and Program Director for the Master of Psychology (Clinical) program (University of South Australia [UniSA]). While at UniSA I lectured across both the undergraduate and postgraduate psychology programs, provided research supervision to honours, master's, and PhD students, and clinical supervision to students in the master's of clinical psychology program. I am still an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of South Australia.I completed my degree at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch (NZ) in 1999 as a ""mature age"" student, graduating in 2002 with a BSc(Hons) 1st class in Psychology. From there, I went on to complete both a PhD and Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology (PGDipClinPsych) concurrently; completing both in 2008. Shortly after completing my qualifications, I started a conjoined position with Central Queensland University as a Lecturer in Clinical Psychology and Queensland Health as a Service Evaluation and Research Coordinator for Evolve Therapeutic Services (ETS). My professional experiences have been varied and diverse, covering university settings, hospital settings, residential treatment facilities, clinical research projects, and clinical practice. I have worked in government organisations, non-government organisations, and privately.My research interests are in the areas that overlap between social, personality, and clinical psychology. I have two intersecting streams of research that I have been developing to lead toward a program of research investigating psychopathology from an evolutionary psychology perspective. My first stream of research is testing and expanding sociometer theory鈥攁n evolutionary theory about the role and function of self-esteem, how it is associated with social acceptance and rejection, and how this might influence subsequent mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). My second stream of research is examining the darker sides of personality, specifically the behavioural and psychological correlates and consequences of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. This second stream of research is also couched in an evolutionary framework and influenced by Life History Theory. These two streams of research, alongside my interest and practice in clinical psychology have led me to start investigating the aetiology of psychopathology from a life history theory perspective.",Associate Professor,Canberra,615868f5d7b0c43ebd755299,Canberra615868f5d7b0c43ebd755299

Holly has a strong social justice focus that is underpinned by her professional identity as a nurse and midwife. Her PhD study, 鈥橦ope for a peaceful death and organ donation鈥?identified that more must be done to alleviate suffering caused by communication failures in healthcare. Holly played an instrumental role in setting up and running the ACT Organ and Tissue Donation Service and has been recognised for her expertise in this specialisation.Holly's research and teaching approaches are framed using the lens of hope and restorative practice to identify and support vulnerable people in health settings. The University of Canberra Collaborative Indigenous Research Initiative have provided more that $100,000 in grant money to support the work of a team of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers (guided by Aboriginal Elders with Holly as CI) to identify restorative practices in healthcare to close the gap on inequitable Indigneous healthcare outcomes. The work of this team is centred on the University of Canberra Hospital and Whanganui Hospital in New Zealand. The work explores the idea that culture leads practice, and by privleging vulnerable voices it is possible to improve healthcare outcomes including performance measures such as clinical indicators, patient and staff satisfaction, staff retention and the budget 'bottom line'. Authentic voice of the most vulnerable voice in health care systems clearly heard throughout those systems are seen as pivotal to improved outcomes.This work also informs acardiac rehabiitation program provided for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women as a research project seeking to create a culturally safe program in an out of hospital environment.In a related area of consumer vulnerability, bereaved families of organ donors are working with a team of academic leaders led by Holly to explore a closed online community of donor's and recipients, and the impacts of their relationships. This work will be publically shared by the consumers in a first of its kind conference scheduled at UC for October the 4th and 5th this year hosted by Donor Families Australia.Other research work that she is currently engaged in includes working with Elders and using Yarning Circles as a restorative practice in teaching health students about contemporary issues related to Indigenous healthcare.Several other projects relating to end of life care, critical care nursing practices and neuro intensive care are also underway in Holly's research portfolio.

Science,,Matt Rutar,,"Matt Rutar obtained his PhD in Biomedical Science from the Australian National University in 2011, at the Research School of Biology. Following the completion of his PhD, Matt took up a postdoctoral position at the John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR) to further pursue his interest in vision sciences, particularly retinal degenerative diseases. After several fruitful years at JCSMR, including leading an independently funded research team with grants from the Ophthalmic Research Institute of Australia and Retina Australia, Matt relocated to the University of Melbourne in 2016 to continue his study of ocular disorders. During this time, he established his own laboratory in the department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, supported by Project Grant funding from the NHMRC. Matt moved his laboratory to the University of Canberra, after accepting the position of Assistant Professor within the Faculty of Science and Technology in 2021. The major goal of Matt's research is to understand the molecular and cellular factors that underscore vision-threatening retinal diseases. Presently, this work focuses on the immunological landscape of the eye, and the environmental and neurodegenerative indicators that orchestrate inflammation in the retina. Chronic inflammatory processes have recently emerged as an important factor underlying the pathogenesis of many retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and accounts for ~50% of all cases of irreversible vision loss in Australia, and has few available treatments. Ultimately, Matt's work aims to uncover new processes of immune regulation in the retina, while simultaneously harnessing this knowledge to develop more effective therapies for retinopathies including AMD.",Assistant Professor,Canberra,61587976d7b0c43ebd755335,Canberra61587976d7b0c43ebd755335

Centre for Change Governance,Gerry.Stoker@canberra.edu.au,Gerry Stoker,,"Professor Gerry Stoker is Professor of Politics and Governance at the University of Southampton, UK and has recently joined ANZSIG as a Centenary Professor. He held previous professorial posts at Manchester and Strathclyde. Professor Stoker's main research interests are in governance, democratic politics, local and regional governance, urban politics, public participation and public service reform. He has authored or edited over 20 books and published over 70 refereed articles or chapters in books. Professor Stoker was the founding Chair of the New Local Government Network which won the UK think tank of the year in 2004 and his most recent book 鈥榃hy Politics Matters鈥?won the 2006 political book of the year award from the Political Studies Association of the UK. Professor Stoker has provided advice to various parts of the UK government and is also an expert advisor to the Council of Europe on local government and participation issues. In 2004, he won the Political Studies Association Award for 鈥榤aking a difference鈥?in recognition of the impact of his work on governance issues.It was in the area of urban politics and local government studies that Professor Stoker first made his name and continues to be seen as a leading authority. He has been a prolific publisher in this area notably The Politics of Local Government, Local Government in Europe, Theories of Urban Politics and Rethinking Local Democracy. For five years (1992-7) Professor Stoker was Programme Director of a 拢2m research endeavour run for the UK's Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC) under the title of the Local Governance Programme. Two edited books captured the main output of the programme The New Management of Local Governance and The New Politics of Local Governance. A single authored book Transforming Local Governance on the reforms undertaken by New Labour was published in early 2004 and later that year an edited book on British Local Government into the 21st Century emerged that analyzed New Labour's reform in more detail. From April 2002 Professor Stoker has been heading up the major Government funded five-year evaluation of the new constitutional and standard arrangements introduced into local government in the UK by the 2000 Local Government Act (see www.elgnce.org.uk for research reports and publications). In more normative vein he has been a strong advocate of a new localism and a greater devolution in the approach to governance both in the UK and beyond.A further theme of Professor Stoker's work has been his interest with citizen participation, social capital and civil renewal. This work led to the development of a heuristic to help public authorities investigate their public participation strategies and identify how they might be improved. The Council of Europe has adopted this CLEAR framework and used it in a range of municipal settings throughout Europe. More recently, Gerry's focus has been on understanding the changing nature of citizen participation in a range of country settings including Australia. Indeed, he will help meet the Institute's aim of designing and analysing unique data sets on the qualities of Australian democracy and (where appropriate) processes of democratisation internationally.",Centenary Professor,Canberra,61587ca2d7b0c43ebd755359,Canberra61587ca2d7b0c43ebd755359

Psychology,Clare.Watsford@canberra.edu.au,Clare Watsford,,"I am currently employed as a Part-Time Lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the University of Canberra and primarily teach into the Master of Clinical Psychology Program (MCP). I am an endorsed Clinical Psychologist with many years of clinical experience working therapeutically with children, adolescents and families, and have pursued research and teach in this area. A driving passion in my teaching, research, supervision and service engagement is bringing together clinical applications and theory to enhance student experience and inform clinical practice to promote engagement and positive clinical outcomes for young people and their families.I have been awarded a total of $460,000 in research funding. In 2019, in collaboration with Professor Rickwood and Dr Buckmaster, I was successfully awarded an external grant from the Capital Health Network (CHN) for $450,000for the project titled 鈥楨arly Intervention for Mood Regulation in Emerging Adults鈥? This project aims to develop, implement and evaluate an innovative program that addresses the need for more effective early interventions and services for young people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in the ACT. The program will focus on mood regulation for emerging adults (aged 15-21 years) at risk of developing BPD. The program represents an exciting opportunity for the University of Canberra, and will provide UC Master of Clinical Psychology students an opportunity to engage in the research evaluation component of the project as well as an external practicum placement opportunity, involving delivery of the clinical intervention under the supervision of specialised clinical psychologists. The program is also an important service engagement for UC to connect with the wider Canberra community, offering a much-needed evidence-based psychology support options for at risk youth.My current research has a real-world impact, with the results informing clinical practice and service delivery for at risk youth and mothers. My current research focuses on the following:Program evaluation of innovative psychological services and programs for at risk young people, including the BPD Mood Regulation program and a youth step up step down residential program.Examining factors affecting perinatal mental health and optimising psychological wellbeing for mothers as well as attachment with their children.Help-seeking factors in promoting accessing psychological support for young people.I currently supervise three Clinical PhD students at the University of Canberra and engage in clinical supervision with the MCP students. I also engage in research supervision for psychology Honours and Masters students.My teaching philosophy is founded on the incorporation of 鈥榬eal-life鈥?clinical case study examples and the use of interactive role plays to help the students appreciate the application of the theory. This mode of teaching better prepares our graduates to enter the profession with practical and professional skills. I ensure all unit material is current, evidence-based and delivered in an engaging, flexible and collaborative manner. I am committed to applying strategies to my teaching that improve student engagement and retention and in utilising feedback to improve teaching quality. A primary part of my role as a member of the clinical psychology team is to ensure unit content and assessment items are in accordance with Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) requirements and in supporting our students to gain core competencies to graduate as competent, professional and work-ready psychologists.",Lecturer,Canberra,6158823cd7b0c43ebd75538c,Canberra6158823cd7b0c43ebd75538c

My interest is how businesses, particularly in the tourism industry identify, analyse, strategise and develop responses to climate change.I am also interested in regional development more broadly, especially in the Canberra Region.I explored these issues partly as an element of my PhD work on policy responses to climate change in the tourism industry, partly through part time employment in the Tourism Program, and also through my research work with Canberra Urban and Regional Futures.These build on previous careers in ecophysiology at ANU and CSIRO, and policy and advising in the ACT Government on economic development, tourism and governance.Recent activity in these areas resulted in co-authored publications including Climate Adaptation Sector Review Informing the Future Direction for the ACT and Region (CURF, 2014); Coastal Urban Climate Futures in South East Australia: from Wollongong to Lakes Entrance (National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, 2013);A Scoping study for a knowledge portal for the Australian Capital Region (CURF, 2012); andConnecting leading research and practice for a sustainable Australian Capital Region (CURF, 2015).",Assistant Professor,Canberra,6158828ed7b0c43ebd75538f,Canberra6158828ed7b0c43ebd75538f
Centre for Applied Water Science,Duanne.White@canberra.edu.au,Duanne White,,"I am a quantitative geomorphologist and geochemist interested in catchment and Earth Systems. For me, this involves understanding the links between landscape, climate and critters, and how these have changed during the Quaternary period 'i.e. the last couple of million years. This interest has taken me across Australia and on several trips to Antarctica, the Arctic and Sub-Antarctic Islands and beyond.My research in polar regions has focussed on generating records of past ice sheet changes, which informs ice sheet model development and projections of future sea level rise. I have utilised isotopic tracers such as cosmogenic nuclides to investigate the dynamics of the ice sheets on glacial-interglacial timescales. Much of my existing work has been on-shore, but I鈥檓 increasingly interested in the offshore part of the system, including developing methods for understanding how ice shelves have functioned in the past.In Australia I have been working to build a picture of how climate and landscapes have evolved during the Quaternary. My teaching program has allowed me to build a diverse understanding of these processes and events, especially in east Australia, and I鈥檓 starting to apply cosmogenic nuclides to investigate the rates and timing of landscape-scale events in the eastern highlands. I have also leveraged my experience in the geothermal exploration industry to investigate past temperatures across eastern Australia from borehole paleothermometry.Since moving to UC, I鈥檝e been exposed to how landscape events affect modern-day patterns of genetic diversity.
