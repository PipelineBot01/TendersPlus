NMP-1667,Education and Training Services,"Respondents are invited to submit a proposal to support the development and delivery of a Naval Shipbuilding College (NSC) to facilitate the delivery of the workforce outcomes required to build and sustain Australia’s naval shipbuilding endeavour, as outlined in the Naval Shipbuilding Plan, released by the Government on 16 May 2017.  Over the next ten (10) to fifteen (15) years, the size and skill level of the naval shipbuilding and sustainment workforce will need to increase significantly to meet the demands created by the Government’s planned investments in naval shipbuilding.  The naval shipbuilding enterprise is too important for the market forces of supply and demand to manage growth and skilling requirements. A national approach to rebuilding the naval shipbuilding and sustainment workforce is required. On 24 March 2017, the Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP announced that the Government will establish a Naval Shipbuilding College to identify, train and retain workers for the naval shipbuilding enterprise.  The NSC project is expected to be delivered through three phases, with progress to the next phase dependent on the successful achievement of the previous phase:• the first phase will commence in 2018 and focus on establishing the NSC; is expected to build capacity and annual throughput at existing education and training institutions across Australia, in key entry level trade qualifications. It will commence a nation-wide communication program, including a career awareness program for school level audiences and workers in adjacent industries; and create a workforce register;• the second phase of the Naval Shipbuilding College is expected to commence in 2020/21. The College will continue to increase capacity and student throughput in key entry-level trades, and will build on this to also achieve increased capacity and throughput in key higher education qualifications (such as naval architecture/engineering) from universities; and• the final phase of the NSC Project could commence from around 2022-2023, subject to successful implementation of the first two phases, and is to develop and construct a purpose-built Naval Shipbuilding College training facility located at the Osborne Naval Shipyard that will offer a range of naval shipbuilding and sustainment education and training that cannot be met from existing institutions.  To support the establishment and delivery of the NSC, the Commonwealth, through the Defence of Defence, is seeking to engage with the broader training and education industry and with potential NSC providers to:• provide informed input and innovative ideas that can be considered by the Commonwealth in determining the optimal service development and delivery solution for the NSC; and• enable an industry partner or partners to be selected to deliver the first two phases of NSC outcomes.    ",Naval Shipbuilding College,6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fe7ba

Proc-9175501,Crop production and management and protection,"The Australian canola industry has produced on average 3.5 million tonnes annually over the past 5 years, with exports alone resulting in $1.6 billion annually. In addition to direct profits from canola production, canola is an essential part of the cropping system, providing significant and reliable yield benefits through the control of diseases and weeds for subsequent cereal crops. The projection for the Australian canola industry is to produce 6.1 million tonnes per year by 2025 (Australian Oilseeds Federation). Some of the main limitations to this expansion and threats to the canola industry are from diseases, especially those caused by fungi. Without the continual control of diseases such as blackleg and sclerotinia stem rot, the canola industry cannot be sustainable or profitable. Furthermore, with the continual expansion of the canola industry the impact of these diseases will only increase due to the intensification of rotations and greater amounts of disease inoculum. The total estimated area planted with canola in 2016 was 615,661 hectares (Northern region), 654,023 hectares (Southern region) and 2,541,302 hectares (Western region) with an average of at least 50% of this being impacted by diseases particularly in the medium-high rainfall zones. The price per tonne in 2016/2017 was $520 and the yield was estimated at 1.4 tonnes per hectare averaged across all regions. With 15% diseases impact, the cost to the industry was over $200M. The aim of this research is to further develop the existing national canola pathology program to maintain the profitability of the canola industry. The project will monitor all diseases of canola and provide information to farmers regarding management of these diseases and risk of yield loss ensuring enduring profitability to the Australian canola growers.","National Canola Pathology Program – epidemiology, surveillance and management strategies",6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fe809

This role is performed by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources who, on behalf of government, is responsible for the management of the policy and legislative frameworks to safely and effectively regulate the offshore oil, gas and greenhouse gas industries. This maintains Australia’s competitiveness in the global market and ensures value is secured from the development of the resources for the community.  The Commonwealth Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (the OPGGS Act) is the overarching piece of legislation to achieve this. Under the OPGGS Act, there are a number of regulations, other associated Acts, guidelines and factsheets, which support the government in efficiently and effectively regulating all aspects of Australia’s offshore resource industries.  Both the Chief Scientist’s Independent Audit of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority’s(NOPSEMA) consideration of the Great Australian Bight (the audit) and Australian Government’s National Resources Statement have recommended increased transparency over how the offshore regime operates and is governed under OPGGS Act.  Specifically, the Chief Scientist has found that improvements to transparency, and the communication of information, and more guidance for the public would increase the overall level of confidence in the regulation and operation of Australia’s offshore oil and gas industry.  In response to the recommendations in the audit and National Resources Statement, the department is considering developing an external facing website, similar in form and function to the Guide to Social Security Law developed by the Department of Social Services, that provides an online policy framework of the OPGGS Act and associated regulations, with the functionality of a portal to other relevant information and data relating to offshore oil and gas activities.  Accordingly, the department invites suitably qualified consultants to submit a tender to scope the work involved in developing the online policy framework for the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas sectors and develop a project plan to assist the department in achieving its objective.",Website development for the provision of policy guidance on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act,6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fe9a0

PROC-9176376,Crop production and management and protection,"Grain legumes have been widely grown in Western Australia, with lupins the most dominant species due to their suitability to acidic sandy soils. Although high value pulses may not be suited to all soil types and regions, there are areas of WA (soil type x environment) where they are highly suited. Despite this, the adoption of grain legumes in these areas has been poor and the proportion of pulses in the farming system is suboptimal and in fact declining. There has also been a stagnation of lupin yields (GN members pers.comms).     Since inception of GRDCs Western Region Regional Cropping Solutions networks (now GRDC Grower Networks), growers have continually highlighted that there are no specifically adapted or consistently profitable break crops/legume options for their farming systems.  Research is ongoing to select for acid and chilling tolerant crop species which will expand the areas where grain legumes can reliably be grown in WA. However even with existing species and cultivars, there are rotational and economic advantages from incorporating grain legumes into the farming system that are not being realised.     Of the commercially available grain legume species, faba bean and lentils are generally acknowledged as being most sensitive to soil acidity, however they are successfully grown on slightly acidic soils (pHCa >5.0 - 6.0) in the high and medium rainfall zones of south eastern Australia, albeit with somewhat inconsistent yields. The experiences of growers and advisers indicate that faba bean are the best pulse crop adapted to high rainfall areas or on soils prone to waterlogging. Chickpea can tolerate a wider range of spring temperatures and have a lower water requirement compared to faba beans so are suited to neutral to alkaline soils in a lower rainfall zone. Chickpeas and lentils can be sensitive to low temperatures and frosts.  There is renewed interest from growers and the agricultural community in grain legume break crops to complement canola and cereals in the rotation. This has been highlighted in the Esperance port zone where the climate for much of the port zone and attitude of the growers is conducive to the success of these alternative legume crops and pastures. ",Closing the Economic Yield Gap for Grain Legumes in WA,6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fea35
PROC-9176388,Crop production and management and protection,"The Grower Network members have raised the opportunity for GRDC to look at the impact of harvesting stubble higher in the Western Region, as they think it may have the potential to change their current farming system. Taller harvested stubble in this investment is referring to taller than current “standard” residue levels for each region within the Western region. Currently most growers within WA, would harvest around 15cm (beer can height) above ground level to maximise HWSC.  This proposed investment is a preliminary step that looks to compare conventional stubble structures and heights, and load (straw & chaff) with taller stubble residue systems, heights and load (mostly only chaff) and in frost risk areas, a no residue system. Treatments will be implemented using grower equipment and will be replicated.   Importantly the investment will include monitoring of soil moisture, plant establishment, presence of disease, weed competitiveness and herbicide efficacy, HWSC options, nutrient budgeting and ultimately grain yield responses. GRDC will negotiate to establish a minimum of 4 trial sites across a widespread area of the Western Region, and in different rainfall zones.",Impact of stubble height on cropping systems in the Western Regin,6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fea36

EOI,Crop production and management and protection,"Several exotic snail and slug species of European origin have established in Australian cropping regions and become significant pests of grain crops. Slugs and snails attack seedling crops, resulting in plant damage and yield impacts and losses associated with the costs of resowing and field control. Snails, additionally, climb crop plants in spring and contaminate the grain harvest, creating significant harvest costs (harvester modifications, damage to machinery, post-harvest grain cleaning) and losses (grain value downgrades, receival rejections) for affected growers, and pose serious market access risks for the industry.  Mollusc management consists of an integrated, year-round approach comprising cultural, mechanical, and chemical (baiting) methods, including: physical control methods prior to crop sowing (e.g., stubble burning, slashing, rolling, cabling and grazing), chemical control methods prior to crop harvest (e.g., baiting in the field with approved chemicals) and physical control methods at or after harvest (e.g., use of a modified header, grain cleaning). Even when performed exceptionally well, these management strategies are not reducing mollusc pressures significantly. The development of improved management tactics for snails and slugs remains a priority to improve growers’ profitability and ensure Australia’s market access is maintained.",EOI to assist with the delivery of More effective control of pest molluscs (snails and slugs) in Australian grain crops,6162aa1fe1b7f5c73e6fea4d
